# GenAI Experiments
This repository contains a number of Gen AI Experiments, mainly focused on integrated LLMs text generation capablities with SPARK.

- [SPARK dataframe automated summarization](spark_analysis)
- [Generation of a SPARK job from natural language](spark_codegen)
- [Distributed LLM inference with SPARK UDFs - Enrichment of dataframe with zero shot learning ](scale_inference)
- [Distributed LLM inference with SPARK UDFs - Enrichment of dataframe with few shot learning ](spark_llm_dataquality)
- [Minimal example of Vertex AI LLM integration on langchain](langchain_vertexai)
