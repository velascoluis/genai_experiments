4,My husband and I LOVE Red Devil. We eat Ina few times a month and order take out at least twice a week. Red Devil never fails to deliver an excellent meal. We generally eat dinner late (after 8pm) so we rarely wait for a table. Dinner hours expect a wait  but definitely well worth every minute!! The take out guys are awesome!! The entire menu is delicious! You can't go wrong with red devil. Enjoy!!
0,Their food size is pretty good one . But honestly the dumplings we got were way worse than my home made ones ... Too plain to have it . My order was pork stone rice which was super plain ...totally killed our appetite that night . Hope they can boost their food flavor up.
2,My mom and I go here quite a bit when we come to the Bellagio to look at the garden display.  The line was not too long but we probably waited about 20 minutes for a table.  Not too bad for this place.  \n\nIt did take a bit for someone to come over to the table.  The drink person took our drink order and then finally the waitress came to take our order.\n\nI had the Thai salad with shrimp.  My mom had the bbq bacon burger with fries.  My salad was really good.  The shrimp were just okay.  They were grilled which was nice but they were not very flavorful shrimp.  The rest of the salad was really tasty though.  It would have been nice though to bring the bread before the entrees as we barely touched the bread and it went to waste.  My mom enjoyed her burger.  It was bit messy but she like the taste.  The fries were good too.  \n\nWe had to flag the waitress down to get our check but she did get us refills for our sodas.  Even though the service was not that good we will probably be back as the food is pretty good.
1,There are a million breakfast places in Montreal that serve this stuff (or better) for less than Chez Cora charges...\nIf you don't take chances on other places  for sure you'll think this is the best breakfast ever...
2,I've been to the Boardwalk Billy's near UNCC a few times but this was our first time here.  It is an average place with average food  but our waitress was very nice.  We though this place would be packed for the AFC Wild Card game but it was pretty empty.  This location is also much smaller than the UNCC location.  There was nothing inherently wrong with the food except maybe the slaw having too much of a vinegar taste to it.  Fried shrimp  steampot  and fish tacos were all par.  They don't have too much craft beer on tap except for Fat Tire  but that's better than nothing.  We may go again if in the area  but also may not make a special trip to go.
4,How did I know when I found the perfect carpet and tile cleaner for my new home?? The guy brought out a black light to inspect the carpet when he came for the consultation! That's right  a black light!!!\n\nMy husband and I found a home to rent with a pool. I am totally against having carpet in a home and  unfortunately  the entire upstairs is carpeted. My husband could not see past the pool  to what may be living in the carpet from past tenants  so I begged the listing agent to have the carpet replaced. That was a big fat no. The carpets were so dirty they were black (supposed to be beige) and the listing agent said they would have them professionally cleaned and I would be pleased. Liar. We signed the lease  went back in the home (after the cleaning) and the carpet was beige again  but was \"crunchy\". My husband agreed to have them re-cleaned by the company of my choice to make me happy. After a quick search on Yelp I found Bradley's Carpet Cleaning. Brian and his brother  Kurt  met us at the house and were both SO super nice. He ran his hand on the carpet to see how crunchy it was and dust started coming out of the carpet like a dust storm. He thought  at first  it was probably residue from the prior carpet cleaner and then whipped out the black light. This was like a slow motion horror show for my husband; he couldn't get across the room quick enough to try to stop him. I am a huge germaphobe and my husband knew whatever was lurking in the carpet could keep me from moving in. My horrors were confirmed.... Either a crazy cat lady with 20 cats lived there or a family with 2 non house broken Saint Bernard's.  Now  I am not insensitive to those with pets  I get it. I have 3 of my own  but they are housebroken and I would like to keep them that way. My fears started towards them \"marking their territory\" if they could smell urine from another animal. Brian was just as disgusted as I was but seemed confident he could help me. \nBrian went over ways I could pre treat the carpet myself with commercial grade enzymes  liquid alive  etc to save money and emailed me estimates for 3 different processes he could do for my carpets in different price points. He even gave me a store and contact person to purchase all the products! I never felt he was trying to up sell me. My husband was going out of town for work  and I was left behind to pack the old house up myself so I went with a treatment option that included them doing all the work over a few days. This is where it gets impressive...\nI found a few crickets in the garage and know they are a food source for scorpions. Our old house had a ton of them and I am hoping to not have the same issue again so I called an exterminator. They called me with a last minute opening and I left work to run and meet them at the house. This was the day Bradley's Carpet Cleaning was coming out to do the initial pretreatment and had no idea I would be stopping by. I left a key for them in a lock box to come and go as they please while they treated the floors so I wouldn't have to be there every time. When I walked in  they were well on their way working on the carpet. They were both on their hands and knees- black lights in their left hand  treatment solution in their right  making sure to get every single spot! At one point  I walked in when Brian was on the stairs and he was scrubbing the front of each stair with treatment solution! Not just the tops! They paid such close attention to detail  it was as if they were going to live there themselves! \nBasically  they cleaned twice after treating the carpet  which was three times overall and I am confident they got them as clean as possible and the only other option would be to totally replace the carpet. Since it's a rental this doesn't make sense for us. Unfortunately  we were still getting dust when we ran our hands across certain areas. Brian stayed on the case and eventually figured out it was tons and tons and tons of carpet fresh from the old tenants! He emailed me his findings and I replied with a passing comment that now I was no longer worried my pets would mark the carpet  but they are both habitual paw lickers and now I was concerned they would end up poisoned by carpet fresh. I envisioned my life for the next year constantly washing their paws! Not even a  1/2 hour later Brian responded- he had contacted WD-40  the makers of carpet fresh  to inquire about it possibly being hazardous to my dog's health and the best way to get it out of the carpet. This floored me  talk about going above and beyond! In case anyone was wondering  it is non toxic to animals! Turns out  Brian is a huge animal lover and his wife is a pet sitter! \nHe also did an awesome job on the tile and grout. It looks brand new! We will definitely hire Bradley's Carpet Cleaning in the future and I have recommended them to everyone I know. My company has also now hired them to clean our lobby and office areas!
2,Great service and clean place   as for the food it was around the typical chinese food buffet style  they did offer a mongolian and sushi section.\nThey had quite a few isles with a variety of different items  some you don't find at a  regular Chinese buffet.
3,Make sure you head over to the Bellagio to check out the beautiful botanical gardens.  When I was here  the Icelandic poppies were in bloom and it filled most of the lobby with a great flowery smell that cancelled out the smoke from the casino.  The butterfly garden and fountains also provided awesome tourist attractions and picture taking spots.  Make sure you bring plenty of patience along with you because there are always massive crowds in the Bellagio.\n\nThe Bellagio has classy architecture  beautiful fountains and a unique botanical garden that all can enjoy but at times the Bellagio seemed more like Disneyland than a posh Vegas hotel/casino.  It is clearly stated on the Bellagio website that unattended children and strollers are absolutely not allowed in the Bellagio.  However  when I was at the Bellagio there were strollers galore and marauding children all over the place.  The Bellagio could do much better in living up to their five star reputation and create a more adult friendly atmosphere by adhering to their own self stated policy involving children.
3,Bouchon  this is such a tough rating. I really struggled with how to rate this restaurant. I begged my husband to come here. I saw this restaurant on Anthony Bourdain and  he said that the fries at Bouchon were better than at his restaurant. The atmosphere was great.\nWe went in for breakfast and I ordered the bread pudding French toast. It was bland. It wasn't bad but it really isn't worth mentioning or trying. I love bread pudding and I love French toast so I thought it would be amazing. My husband on the other hand ordered the sourdough waffle...it was AMAZING.  It was so good I wanted to eat it slowly so it would last. We went back the next day and ordered the waffles again...they were wonderful.\nMy issues  neither the waffle nor the bread pudding came with a side and for the price and portion size it should come with a side. As for the fries  well we ordered a side and they were so overcooked we sent them back. They brought us out another side of fries and they weren't much better. They were too hard and too crispy. If you like the small  hard and crispy fries these may be for you. But I didn't think they were very good. \nThe service was also good. So with how wonderful the waffles were but with how average almost everything else is... I still have to give this place 4. More than I remember any of the average aspects....I remember how wonderful those waffles taste.
1,Every year we celebrate joint birthdays with our best friends at a SPECIAL restaurant. Over the years  we have always enjoyed our dining  experiences- that is until we went to Del Frisco this year. My friend and I always order a rib eye or NY strip. Every so often  we'll have prime rib. Our wives invariably order lobster  etc.\nThis evening  the waitress convicted us to order their special 12oz. Rib eye and crab cake including veggies and dessert. We thought it strange when she told us we could get the promotion for only $99 per couple. We questioned her about the quality of the meat and amount of filler in the crab cakes. She assured our every skepticism  so we agreed to the special.\nThe steak was thin and so over seasoned that my wife  who never complains  called for the waitress. An assistant manager came over and was very apologetic  replaced her steak  and sent over the manager. When we questioned him about the steak quality  he began to explain about butchering. Since we weren't interested in his explanation  he  comped the meal. We thought that was the right thing to do under the circumstances. \nWhen I go to a highly touted Restaurant  the last thing I was is to be comped because the steak is not top quality. It is an admission of their failure to live up to the billing.
4,Just go here  and order a battleship. If Kris makes it  its even better!
0,Today I went in to get a gel manicure  like I have multiple times before at this location. my usual choice is closed on Mondays and I needed to tend to my nails before I headed on a trip! \n\n25 dollars for a gel manicure you can't go wrong right? Oh boy was a wrong.. So very wrong! I am usually satisfied by the sub par manicure I receive but today was a disaster. I have never had such a painful manicure. Not only did she dig at my cuticles until raw skin was exposed a new lady had to finish my manicure because the paint looked terrible. And I requested it to be fixed! Meanwhile she poured acetone on my exposed skin to get the initial paint off of my nail! In which this has left my skin so dry that my hands are peeling!!! After being there for over an hour and a half for just a gel manicure I was so dissatisfied that I skipped half of the manicure and was still charged full price!!!\n\nAmazing... Never will I be going back to this place and if you're looking for a clean efficient manicure look elsewhere!
0,pretty terrible pizza joint.  I like TJ's much more.  I've tried this place twice  and both times  it was pretty bad.  The first time  I just ordered two slices.  They took two pretty old cheese pieces of pizza out of their warming rack  threw on pepperoni and mushroom on top if it  and just served it.  I think the pizza had been in the warming rack for several hours.  The second time I tried them  I just ordered a small pizza so I knew it would be fresh.  It was  very bleah  even for pizza.  Don't  waste your money.
4,I can't believe I am the first to rate this restaurant.  I ate here in October 1997.  I'm still thinking about that meal 12 years later.  The lobster in vanilla and the dessert plate  with its ten or so tiny desserts  each a different pearl or diamond  stick in my mind as the single best meal ever eaten in four decades of dining out.  Paris on the cheap.  If you are in Montreal  not to be missed. Gerard Fort  the chef (who is  I think  the same chef from 1997)  grew up and trained in France. He's the real deal.
0,Same situation. \nI called yesterday to schedule an appointment. I made sure to ask if the rental was definitely available and I was assured it was. I made the appointment. Called today to verify and there was no record of me making it (even though yesterday  I received an email from the company detailing the appointment!).  Leasing Agent's name I was given was Ryan and I am not sure he even works for them. The whole company is weird and I would not trust renting from them. \n\nStay away if you're renting  their is something weird going on there.
0,Officially offended by this place. Employees talking about her husband getting hit by a car  swallowing  sexualness of each race  and screaming. Repulsed.  Did I mention the manager was standing there laughing with them?
2,If I could give this burger joint 2 1/2 stars I would. Mixed experience at its' best.\n I was shocked at how sparse the menu was- NO  salads  onion rings  baked potatoes or shakes or.. anything else.. but mainly burger  fries and hot dogs. Everythjing in blinding red and white colors.\n  Um ok... So we ordered. We liked how the toppings were free and that they had ones we actually liked. \nThe order was for three: One bacon burger got a 10 out of a 10 rating and some love. The other two  a 5 out of 10. To me ( Yeah I was a 5..) it was just a good greasy burger. I expected much more  something to give it a wow factor. There needed to be a  \"You couldn't make this at home if you tried\" factor... but there was none.\n The fries were just cut friend potato with some salt . ( Again nothing you can't make at home). No one liked the fries especially. They were passable but nothing to go on about and the large is about 5 bucks  it will feed a lot of people but who needs that many fries??! The President of fried food addicts are us???!!\n The Peanuts  I totally don't get it. They just want you to buy a drink.\n The drink machines rock! I loved these and was like a kid in the candy store. I regressed to about 10 years old and became giddy with the choices of so many of my faves. And if you can't have sugar there are choices for you too besides Diet coke and unsweetened tea like most places have.\n The lighting is  too bright and it's so noisy our nerves were shot leaving the place. I would not go back again unless someone else wanted to go. You pay a lot for decent food that really could be made at home. If you want a huge artery clogging lunch to perk up your dreary work day go fit but be prepared to spend a lot and do some sit ups afterwards. :) This place will fit the bill for most burger enthusiasts  but it wasn't for me  I am not a fries person either...
0,There was one person ahead of me at the register and one person in the drive through and they got all of our orders wrong even after the three staff behind the counter stared and stuttered at each other for twenty minutes.
3,Recommend to go before 630 pm to void the long wait  this location is better than irvine branch. More sushi selection and I love their clam soup. Oyster is a little bit under quantity control so I wasn't able to eat as much like hikari :( but quality is not bad.
1,We made a stop at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort for lunch and ended up at the Ironwood American Kitchen.   \n\nPros:   \n\nNice setting  we sat on the patio with a view of the pool.\n\nGood service.\n\nLiked that they left big bottles of water on the table since it was close to 85 degrees during our visit.  Nice touch.\n\n\nCons:   \n\nFood was so so.  We ordered two different salads and neither was remarkable.   They told us they had just gone to a farm to table concept.  I guess that's why the servers all wear jeans.   \n\nAt lunch we were presented a cocktail menu where our server pointed to the limited selection of cocktails they could make during the afternoon.  We ordered two different margaritas.  One was their regular  the other was the special.   Neither were good.\n\n\nMaybe it would be a better place to try for dinner.   They could do a much better job on their lunch menu and food preparation.
2,I have lived down the street from Roadrunner for about 6 years but had never ventured in until a couple of days ago after having bought a Groupon. We didn't end up using it as we were there during happy hour and our dinner of Cowboy Poppers (Jalapenos stuffed with cheese and pulled pork)  Sliders  Chicken Wings  a Bud Light  and a Sprite was well under our $30 Groupon. The food was pretty decent. I liked the filling in the poppers but the breading could use some work. The sliders were cooked past the medium I had requested but still pretty good. The chicken wings were chicken wings.\n\nNext time I think I'll try the Southwest fried pickles and the pulled pork sandwich. And I think I'll bring my parents so the tab exceeds the Groupon.
4,Stayed here for four nights (Thursday through Monday) and the hotel won me over. The room was first class with everything I could ever need. HUGE shower (room for wife  girlfriend  & FB) and tub was nice/ separate from shower; but all enclosed to one another. Fully stocked bar with pull down service every evening. Additionally at night  they fill your ice bucket too and leave chocolate bedside. Flat screen on the wall with an iPad to control the entire room (Even the shears and black out drapes) were controlled by a button on the wall or the iPad. Very pleased with accommodations of hotel. Things around hotel are pricey  just like all the hotels for a beverage cost of $11.50  but lots of nice candy; if u know what I mean. Thumbs up in my book  I'll be saving my bucks to come back 2014!  Pool was nice; but I gotta due some work on those abs brother!!!
2,Beers are relatively inexpensive for proximity to the strip. Some shady characters chill here but it makes for great people watching.
3,Some people think the name is R-rated but it actually stands for a toad with horns. \n\nThe Fried Chicken alone is worth the treck -- freshly plucked  never frozen and you can taste the difference. You can order a half chicken but for only a few dollars more you can get a whole chicken for about $18 which can feed 3 people. The hamburger was just OK but the Grilled Chicken Salad was huge -- it can easily feed 2-3 people. On a nice day  sit out on the patio and imbibe the Cave Creek ambiance. We've always had good service here and my tourist friends always enjoy this place.
0,Foods ok. Service sucks! So many servers and none come to help out. Hostess was to busy texting to acknowledge us until the photographer told her she had people.
3,The chef here has is better than average. I ordered the steamed Red Snapper.  Excellently prepared!  Rice and peas is a bit bland. Also had a side of Jerk Chicken as an appetizer: best I had in Charlotte. \n\nMy side of plantains was made fresh-to-order. Delicious! I will have to come back to try some other dishes.
3,Enjoyed the sushi and had great service. The boards behind the bar advertise their specials. They offer an all-you-can-eat menu  but I have found that I prefer ordering directly off the menu because not all the rolls I want are featured on the all-you-can-eat menu.  Frequent customers have a pair of personal chopsticks kept at the restaurant  but I have yet to figure out how to get one of those.
0,I'm still getting mailers from this place. Nope. I won't go. Keep your stinky coupons. Boo.
2,This is not a great cheesesteak but  it's serviceable for a reasonable price and is served quickly at this location of the PC.  The restaurant itself looks to have seen better days but the service is friendly and  as mentioned  the food gets to you fast.  They don't have the fries warming under a light  instead they are dropped about the time your steak and onions hit the grill so you get them hot and crispy with a dusting of seasoned salt.\n\nOn the Original cheesesteak you get steak  onions and choice of white american and provolone cheese.  I like the hoagie version which has lettuce  tomato and olive oil.  My only asks would be more seasoning on the meat as it's cooked and some vinegar to go with the olive oil and cut some of the fattiness.
2,It's not a bad hotel at all  but it is just very old and is shadowed under the much fancier hotels in Vegas.\n\nI've stayed here twice because it was cheap. $49 for a room on a weekend isn't bad at all. \n\nRoom was clean  basic  smelled fine  but I found it a little hard to breathe at night. Mattresses were a little too hard for my liking but what can ya do..\n\nPool is small but nice enough. I spent a lot of time out there swimming in it and sitting by it. Drinks they serve in the poolside bar are WEAK though. \n\nGambling is affordable but this is definitely NOT  a \"happening\" hotel for people in my age group which is 20s. And I think those of us in our 20s who stay there don't EXPECT it to be either.... come on we know we're just staying here because it's cheap.  Just sleeping here  not hanging out here. My friends and I actually walked to the Wynn hotel which is right next door at one point.\n\nThe bartenders in the casino at 3 in the morning were pretty nice  friendly and helpful  though. That was cool.\n\nSelf parking garage really sucks though... not enough spaces and the elevators are pretty scary.
3,Jen is my favorite!  Love the fact this place has no television!  I always hate leaving because I am so relaxed.  They have waxing and eyelash extensions.  I believe they offer a $50 discount on the eyelashes on Mon  Tues  and Wed.
1,Kind of a dark place to be.  The building is long and skinny.  When we walked in we were not greeted in a friendly manner actually we were not greeted at all. We noticed there were reserved signs on all the tables that had daylight on them so we were directed to the back where they have creepy crescent shaped booths.\n\nThey have daily specials and the special was $5 cosmos so we all ordered one.  It was really good and really strong!  One is all you need.  We also ordered the margherita pizza  artichoke dip & the fancy mac & cheese.  The pizza was good  the dip was fabulous and the mac & cheese was gross. I do not know why they called it fancy mac & cheese.  The noodles were too big and chewy and the cheese did not have any flavor.  It was bland and boring and sticky.  Nothing fancy about it all so that was misleading.\n\nThe dip had some hotness to it and had good flavor and consistency.  None of the food came out hot.  The pizza cheese was luke warm at best so I think it was sitting in the kitchen waiting to be brought out for a while.\n\nOur waitress was really nice and very helpful with helping us select menu items.\n\nWould I go back?  Yes  I would go back and try something different and hopefully we could sit somewhere towards the front and the light of day.  This place is really dark.
0,After this last time I stayed here I will never stay here again. We had a wedding here on the Pirate Ship  so we decided to stay here as well. \n\nFirst we walked up to the invited guests line  because part of the wedding package we were. You would think in this line the people that have the best customer service would be here  this was not the case. I asked for an upgrade from our suite and right away we were told no. I told her we had about 20 rooms booked for all our guests and we had purchased the pirate ship so we were giving them thousands of dollars of business and they could not comp 600 bucks  she did not even bother looking into this. \n\nNext we reserved a room on a floor for my wife's mom with all of our other guests. This was really important to her that she be on this floor and we expressed this when we checked in. Her mom got there a few hours later and they gave her room away so her mom had to be on another floor. \n\nNext at the wedding we had brought our own song for the end music and we tested it the day before on the chapel and it worked on their system. The day of the wedding they come running up to my wife just as she is about to walk out and told her that the song would not work outside  my wife told them to ask me what to I wanted to play in place of it. They never asked me  and at the end of the cermony they choose the song on their own  turned to be Elvis  Vivia Las Vegas which is about the stupidest song to play for a wedding. \n\nThe rooms here are nice  but if you expect anything in terms of service don't stay here. These people don't know what service is and treat you like crap.
4,Another favorite Chinese noodle joint for us to eat at here in town since the long-gone and not forgotten Shanghai Noon owned by HK actor  Samo Hung. We walked in right on time for the nightly noodle making/stretching. This place reminds me of the masters over at Malan Noodles that are in SoCal and all over Beijing. As mentioned in another review  English can be a bit of a challenge here. For those not interested in the noodles  they also offer a selection of  \"Westernized\" Chinese dishes including fried rice and chow mein. But why bother  they should be known for their noodles like their namesake.\n\nOne thing for certain  I like the flavors here more than Malan which I find slightly bland. The noodles are tender and chewy. After perusing the menu  the owner's husband recommended the following: \n\n-Special Flavor Beef Noodle Soup ($6.95). Served with slices of marinated beef and wood ear (fungus). The soup base is made from beef stock and a secret blend of 28 spices (and you thought the Colonel used more spices) with Star Anise as the dominant spice. What a wonderful medley of flavors tingling my palate. \n\n-Special Flavor Tomato Egg Noodle Soup ($6.95). The soup base reminds me of my mother's tomato and egg dish; slightly sweet with a zest of tomato flavor and sprinkling of eggs. \n\n-Vegetable Dumplings (pan fried $4.95). Perfect for the vegetarian or someone who doesn't want any meat in their dumplings. Instead of the traditional dumplings that are fried individually  the chef made it into a flower shape that you separate into individual pieces. What a neat way to present dumplings! \n\nSure  the place is in the wrong side of town for me. But  it is certainly worth the trek. \n\nFlavorful broth. Check. \nFresh tender and chewy noodles. Check. \nHappy stomach. Check. \n\nSolid 4.5 Stars
3,The ice creams/gelatos here are excellent.  I have tried the pistachio  cheesecake  and mint flavors and they are all great.  Their ice creams/gelatos are creamy and rich (not watered down)  but I never feel guilty after enjoying my snacks here.  I especially love their milkshakes!
3,It's your average Kohls. Clean and well organized. The staff I encountered were all friendly and offered assistance. Would shop here again.
3,Love this place! Fresh eggs  homemade hash browns  fresh squeezed orange juice  delish thick bacon  very reasonable prices....
3,Been here 3 times. I love the ambiance  the best. Like it better than Town Square   its more cozy  stores are closer together  bettter place to walk during summer Vegas heat. I ate at Cafe Leone with my kids 4 times already and shopped at Charming Charlie 3 times. Im not tired of going to those places again and again. Most stores and restaurant are just pricy but quality.
2,We've been fans of Lon's for years. The patio  the dining room  the food  was always dependable and a cut above.  For Sunday brunch  I ordered the chopped salad.  When it arrived I thought I'd been transported to a fast food take out. Iceberg lettuce  2 pieces of dark green lettuce  3 microscopic pieces of chicken  and a decorative something or other on top...I have never  did I say never  sent anything back in a restaurant  but back this went. I reordered the turkey burger  which another in my party had and hadn't complained about. The waiter was most gracious and accommodating. The side salad with the burger was fine. The burger was dry and tasteless; my husband later said that his was too. The other two people in our party had omelettes and were very pleased with their selection.  All in all it was a disappointing experience. I don't know if this will continue to be our \"go to\" place for lunch and brunch. The kitchen needs a jolting heads up and perhaps a new chef.
1,The worst service of any bojangles I've been to. The orders rarely come out right. How hard can it be to put chicken in a box?
3,The chicken strips were really good but the sauce they provide to dip sorta sucked. Maybe I can try it again next time I'm in Vegas...
1,This is a pretty funny story. My friends and I came here for opening night  way back when. Phelps was being his high spender self and was ordering martinis and shots. The night had barely begun and chicks in skanky dresses were pushing and acting all hard. This one girl kept hitting my arm and it was really annoying. I don't really like this atmosphere but Phelps was paying  right? Maybe a half hour in and all of a sudden the girl who kept bumping into me turned around and smashed her martini glass into this girls head! Woah! What the Fluff? Glass was everywhere and the girl had blood running down her face. \n\nWe were herded upstairs and with the help of some free drinks  started partying and dancing  forgetting the incident.  DJ Nugget was playing some sweet mixes. It ended up getting very crowded so I left.\n\nI did go back a couple of times later with friends  but only when my favorite DJ's were there. Since then it's gotten old. I never got a WOW factor from the place. They have valet parking because it is impossible to park in the Southside. I don't know why but it seems like all these types of clubs are filled to the brim with douchers! No thanks.
2,Typically I give a place that falls in the middle of great and bad multiple chances.  For whatever reason it's easier for me to 1  4 or 5 star a place after the first visit  rather than 3.  As far as yelp is concerned  3 stars isn't a bad thing - \"A-OK.\"!\n\nThe scene is strange.  It's a mix of typical Arcadia  Scottsdale and the like.  This place is more of a sports bar than anything  in my eyes  with better food than your typical sports bar fare.  Seriously.  There's like 14 televisions in here.\n\nService is quick-ish.  Food is fresh.  The servings are very large.  Some things waver on decent-to-bland  while other things are pretty swell.  The mac & cheese is a pass  in my opinion  and not worth the $5 (for the small cup you get - ah  contradictory to my large servings note!).  Some dishes have an overpowering taste  while other leave you wondering if you're eating food or chewing crunchy water (that sounds gross now that I've typed it out!).\n\nBeer and liquor list is pretty typical; nothing to note really.  A few changes here and there and I could see it as a really decent spot.  The same could be said for the food  really.\n\nI'll be back  yet again  The Garage just hasn't blown me away yet.  Also  on a funnier note: \"Garage\" reads easily as \"Garbage\" on the menu  which was kind of comical.
0,So I don't eat sushi but I went for a batch party and the bride along with the other 10 girls I went with all eat sushi these girls had nothing but complaints about the food.  They said it is so over priced for the quality of food they also said they wouldn't go back next time they go to Vegas.  Since I don't eat sushi I was left with almost nothing to eat I could either get 2 tiny chicken squares or a $35 steak and that was not what I wanted right before heading out to the bars so I got the tiny chicken and edemame which was not filling but those were my choices.
2,The food is good! Though the chairs are not too comfortable if you stay on the booth the people pass by a lot! Suggest not to stay on the side if you really want to watch the game and not get dizzy!
1,A really nice club with cool lighting and a few different rooms to explore. However  it's just too small & cramped for the large crowds they let in--you can barely move on the dancefloors and it's a constant struggle to stay afloat as people bump into you every few seconds. Merp!\n\nWe got in for free/discount with a promoter and got here early but still had to wait a long time and deal with hella lines to get in. That's to be expected for such a popular club for sure  but I usually don't have such a long wait at Marquee.\n\nPauly D DJs here a lot - does that excite anyone? Not me ;)
1,I'm continually surprised by the ratings for this place.   Service was decent.   Food average .  Price high.   I just don't get it.\n\nThis review won't be long enough to score  as epic because I can say it in one word \"meh\"
0,We'll that do I have to say... Once you walk in you get hounded by the workers.  1st when you walk in then like 3 in the middle of the store then like 3 cashiers in  the back . Like I know customers is good but they take it to the next level  when I get attacked by the workers I just want to tell them to leave me alone   when I go shopping In there I have my head phone on and volume up so they won't bug me I have walked out a few time and just bought what I need online just to stay away from the pushy workers  
2,Bento Box lunch!\n\nThey do a really cool \"bento box\" lunch special most every day (or weekends at least) that is always a very creative mix of food. \n\nWe had dinner here once  and while it was great  for the money I'd likely pick other places  but a solid choice.\n\nif you like ginger ale  they make theirs fresh  and it's fantastic. Call ahead as they had been closed for renovations and not sure if they are open again.
2,A little confusing to figure out how to get to the main floor and reception area at first but once you got it figured out it's fantastic.\n\nThe Hilton is located downtown right near all the action of St. Catherine and Peel Street. The hotel itself is located on the corner of Rue Mansfield and Rue de La Gauchetiere. McGill University is a straight shot up Mansfield so if you're looking to visit some friends at McGill you're not too far off. Also Crescent Street is not too far from the hotel. That is where you will find the Hard Rock Cafe  Thursday's  Sir Winston Churchill's  Ben & Jerry's  Newtowne  Paris Crepe  etc. Just travel a few blocks west on St Cathrerine and take a right on Crescent.\n\nThe hotel atmosphere is quiet and nice. It's in an old building that could appear to some as dingy for a Hilton  but it's actually quite nice. The hotel bar staff and reception desk clerks were very helpful and friendly. Warning for the bar: a tall cheap beer (Molson Dry) ran me $10/each. It shouldn't really cost much more than $7 elsewhere.\n\nThe hotel has free internet but not wi-fi. In your room there is a LAN wire that you can conntect to your laptop. You can purchase higher internet speeds for a certain price per MB.\n\nThe bed was the most comfortable thing I have ever slept on and the rooms are spacious. I will definitely be back.
1,This place is about ambience and atmosphere.  The service was poor and I had the worst wrapped dates ($9) ever.  They were so bad  I couldn't eat them even when I was hungry.  Waste of time and money.
1,I usually don't shop at Bashas' and now I know why. I went to the Blockbuster store located in the same strip mall and realized I needed to get something for dinner that I didn't have. Not wanting to waste time driving to another store  I ran into here.\n\nUpon walking in  I noticed how old and dirty this place was compared to other markets.  My wife was appalled at the conditions. Her comment to me after we walked out with our grocery bag \"Let's never go here again\"!\n\nI've heard you save some money at Bashas'  but I don't think that is the case. I found the prices to be about the same or in some cases more. The meat quality was poor (in my opinion).\n\nSome of the check out stands were ones I recall when I was a kid in the 80's. The old turnstiles. I was shocked they had a price scanner given how ancient they were. \n\nFor me  Basha's doesn't even come close to Fry's  Safeway  Sunflower or Trader Joe's. Bashas' is well below the other chain super markets.
4,This was just lovely.\n\nThere is nothing like relaxing in comfort while waiting for your flight to come along.\n\nThe staff inside are all very friendly and provide VIP treatment.  The bar serves large complimentary cocktails along with your complimentary dinner buffet - which was SCRUMPTIOUS!\n\nPlenty of outlets to charge up your phones and laptops while lounging on very comfy couches  benches  tables  you name it - whatever is your fancy.
4,Happy Father's Day 2013!!!\n\nThe gurlpren took me here for Father's Day and I admit  I would have never found this place because it's located smack in the middle of a residential area.  We arrived right before noon and it was still a little quiet  especially for great day like Father's Day.  Dining for us was outside and even though we were in the middle of 100+ degree Vegas weather  we were kept cool with the shade and cool mist. The service was great  staff was attentive  and the ambiance was relaxing.  My GF had a view of the lake  which was the relaxing part. My opinion  I had the best view. \n\nAs for their food  lets start with their menu.  Their menu for brunch was simple and prices are what to expect from a French Restaurant.  Actually  their prices for what you get are pretty good. I got their Steak & Eggs  which is also served with some home fries. The steak was the highlight. I would guess about 6 oz of well seasoned  well prepared  and thinly sliced steak.  Normally steak & eggs come a little dry. Not here  their steak was juicy and delicious.  For my pre-steak meal  I got a cup of their French Onion Soup.  This was delicious as well. It wasn't overly salty and had enough of an onion kick to it. \n\nThis was my first time here and I was impressed with their service and quality of food.  I'm still curious what dinner is like here so I'm going to have to come back. I'm also appreciative to my GF for surprising me with memorable Father's Day brunch.  1OAK!  \n\nSteak & Eggs:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bsDfORivIAUj9CIkPL5FyQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nFrench Onion Soup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YnmW7qmYq_QgVaAjqr99_A&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ
3,I went here when the club first opened and wow it set a new standard. The bouncers (and pretty much everyone who works at the Wynn) are nice and real with you. The layout is way nice except the dancefloor is way small. The outside is beautiful but it sucks if it's winter and it's cold outside. \n\nIf you can  get a table here it will greatly increase your chances of having a great night.
1,This is probably the only thing that hacks me about The Wynn. I'm not a fan of buffets. Mostly because you never know who's dirty little kid stuck their fingers in the mashies  or how long the food has been sitting out. That being said  I've had my share of buffet experiences in Vegas and I actually prefer the Planet Hollywood one to this spot. \nI felt the selection was lacking  service was slow  and the price just really didn't match up with the amount of sub-par food I was able to consume. \nWas it the worst? Nah  but I won't be returning.
3,R n R is beautiful  I just love the architectural features.. delicious before you even step inside the door! They have two floors of inside/outside seating  tons of waiters/bartenders and usually great music.Saturday/Sunday afternoons they usually have it loud!! (Which I like).  \n\nI like this place because you could bring your mom for lunch or your boyfriend for late night. They have all kinds of appetizers. I would say the flavor is mainly American with a twist. I've had the \"animal fries\" and they are delicious  also the nachos are good and the sliders.. Actually I have to say all the food I have tried has been good. For the portions it does seem like a medium priced place in comparison to other spots that are fancier (Herb Box and Bandera). I have sat inside  and on both floors of the outdoor patios. The decor is very nice  and overall I really like this place and plan to come back.
3,I was very impressed. The atmosphere was a little over a top  but I would expect nothing less for the location.\nAllison  our server was great. Honest  efficient  and knowledgable.\nMy wife and I had some cheese to start  a lovely goat from Vermont  served on perfect bread.\nI had the butternut squash canneloni. I would give it a 9.7.\nThe food was great  resonably priced  I can't wait to return....
3,One night  after a particularly difficult shift at the Southwest Naturopathic Medical Center  a fellow student and I decided to let loose and head over to the bar next door  Mardi Gras.  We were just looking for a drink to wind down and possibly an appetizer.  \n\nWe walked in  not knowing what to expect.  The bar is rather open and not at all crowded.  Actually  I think there were half a dozen people in there  not including the bartender Breeana.  And someone was painting the ceiling (that was a little odd at 10 PM).  After a minute to peruse the specials listed on signs all over the place  we decided on our beverages and an order of chicken wings.\n\nLet me preface the rest of this review with the fact that I was born and raised in Buffalo  New York  home of the original chicken wings.\n\nThe wings are fantastic.  They're fried to a perfect crispiness  not overcooked and dry  nor undercooked and gummy  and definitely not breaded.  The sauce is not the original Buffalo sauce of Frank's and butter  but it is really good.  It is a perfect combo of vinegar-y-ness and spiciness.  I guess they have other flavors  but that would be heresy for me to even try.\n\nMy only complaint is that they have ranch and not bleu cheese.  Not that I often use the bleu cheese  but it's comforting to know that it's there if I want it.  And there is only carrot sticks  not carrots and celery like I'm used to.\n\nThe guy who makes the wings is super friendly and comes out to check if they were cooked right (note to self: learn this guy's name).\n\nAnd the bartender Breeana (I have no idea how to spell her name) is friendly and used to work at Houston's.  This week she was making a mojito for another customer and let us try a straw-full.  It was very yummy from the bit I tasted  but I think I'm going to try it next week.  \n\nThe Mardi Gras quickly became our Wednesday night ritual  and I'm going to miss the trend at the end of this quarter.  But I'm still at the clinic on other nights  so I'll just have to make it over there on a new night.
0,In the past I have really enjoyed the Green Chile Chicken Burrito  but after a MASSIVE price increase in May  I will not be returning. The aforementioned item was $9.50. The price has now increased 33% to $12.50. I might add  this is an ala carte item and was not enchilada style. Simply a burrito and a little lettuce for aesthetics. When i asked the server  he said they raised prices across the board by one-third  shortly after Cinco de Mayo. Want a margarita? That will set you back $12-15. Really? Simply overpriced!
4,You ever eat at a place and a day later  two days later  you're still thinking about that meal?  You can't wait to go back and you're plotting your next opportunity to get back there?  This is one of those places.  We had lunch here and ordered scallop sashimi  yellowtail sashimi  salmon and avocado handroll  King Crab rolls with the crunchiest shrimp tempura on top.  It was all delicious.  Amazingly fresh  beautifully plated and just yum.  Service was incredibly friendly and they accommodate gluten free diets  with GF tempura batter and wheat free soy sauce.  You can't get better than this little place and I can't wait to come back and try their other plates.
3,My cousin and I ate dinner  here before going to see Zumanity. We had pineapple fried rice and curry chicken  both were excellent. The drinks were great too! She had a Grape soda cocktail and i had the Green Dragon Mojito  my favorite drink of the entire trip!. Our server Garfield was excellent  very friendly. Would definitely go back!
2,This Sears gets three stars for selection and pricing but it is old and needs to be remodeled. The restroom was not stocked at all. Only one soap dispenser had soap n it. Paper towel container was broken and hanging open. No seat covers and not much toilet paper. Not clean at all. Gross!
2,Went to this place and got the all day pass for $30. Breakfast was pretty good. They had basic things that you would expect  eggs  bacon  waffles  french toast. We were too late for the omelet bar. \nDinner was a little disappointing. Not as many choices as some of the other buffets in the area. For the price though  you could not go wrong. $30 all you can eat for the day is great.
4,First tried this lovely little breakfast joint about two years  and have been dying to come back! It usually ends up that I'm in a different part of town or in the neighborhood after Matt's is closed. Absolutely delicious breakfasts! And huge! In a nicely decorated downtown space! The service is on the ball - but you almost feel a little hurried. Still  an undeniably fantastic breakfast! I would rank Matt's in my Top 5 Breakfasts of All Time (yes  I am that serious about breakfast).
4,This location has probably the worst staff of all the locations I've been to  but that's probably because it's by the mall and wanted young people even if they aren't good.\n\nThat being said  shlotskys in general are a fantastic sandwich place  lots of choices  and always delicious !
3,A lot of people hate on this place but I LOOOOVE Tao.  My friends and I have been several times and we are always treated like royalty! Tao plays the best music (a nice blend of hip-hop  Top 40 and house) and the club itself is beautiful!  They have dancers flying through the sky to those with table service delivery bottles of liquor.  Going to Tao is an experience and one not to be missed if you are in Las Vegas.\n\nLadies my suggestions are:\n\n#1. Check it out on a Friday night and take advantage of the free drink wristbands if available\n\n#2.  Make sure you have made contact with a promoter prior to your trip so you can get your party in for free\n\n#3.  Get there early so you can get your groove on before the club gets crowded (and it does get crowded!)\n\n#4.  If your pockets are deep enough  spring for the bottle service.  You won't be sorry.\n\nAt the end of the day I would rather be in a crowded club versus a dead club.  Just a thought. Check it out!
2,I had the crab rangoon  cashew chicken  fried rice  and seafood curry. I wasn't impressed by any of the dishes. I've had Thai at many places in the valley and after seeing reviews I had high hopes for Malee's  but the food didn't do it for me. Good location  good service  but overall I'll go somewhere else for Thai next time.
0,Horrible job just don't waste your money coming here. They literally don't care about how your nails will look they just want to hurry up and finish !
1,$8 / pp cover starting at 7 pm on a Saturday. 20 minutes until we were even greeted by our server. $12 for a Stoli martini. 100 decibels of loud  though not particularly enthusiastic  piano bar standards. \n\nThe numbers don't lie  this place is pretty lame. Looking for a sing-a-long piano bar experience? Head to Tempe where you'll get more 'Bang' for your buck.
4,On a hot day   looking for a good mexican slasa   landed up here   places was good and not crowded. Ordered margarita and Nachos and I woukld say best  nacho I ever had. Very friendly atmosphere as well.
2,Bartenders are rude. The atmosphere is a little 'guido'-esk   the jams are mostly techno.  PACKED on weekends.  Still really fun because everyone is dancing.  Drinks are way overpriced.  The kind of place you go when you wanna party hard and get completely hammered.  Oh yeah- don't go if you wanna 'hang out' with your friends. this place is for dancing  WAY too loud to hear anyone even if you scream.
2,ok so I like them however for some reason the top part of the pizza is always a little under done. Bottom of pizza is always cook great and crust but sometimes if you get a bite of raw dough its not the best. is there way to request the top being cooked a little longer. ?
2,Okay spot for lunch.  The salads are pretty good.  A little pricey for what you get.  I wouldn't drive here to eat lunch  but if you work within walking distance it is a reasonable alternative.
2,After two meals at Verona  my verdict is not good. \nThe first meal included a sumtuous soup of basil  cream  rice and chicken  it was a home run. The caesar salad was way above average  and although the pasta under the Chicken Parm was so over cooked it was inedible  the chicken itself was great. On that visit almost all the food was great  but the service was amaturish at best. My server was nice  but had no idea how to deliver a fine dining experience  from steps of service  verbage  and timing it was all just so much less then I expected it to be.\n\nBased on the teriffic food I decided to go back for what seemed like well priced steaks  the awsome cibata bread and butter  and that great Caeser salad. \nThe Basil chicken soup wasnt available so I opted for the Ministroni soup  This soup was flavorless and almost raw. The pasta  carrots  and beans were under cooked and the broth was clear. The soup only tasted like the fistfull of fresh basil that was on top. Two bites into my Ceasear salad I had to pull a fine blond hair from my mouth  and the love affair with this salad was over. \n\nThen the steak  it a was huge Porterhouse that was requested medium yet served med-rare it could have used a few extra minutes on the grill and not served at the same time as my salad. For the most part the steak was tender  but had an odd flavor  kinda like an old peice of meat  not like aged beef  which I doubt it was based on the price. Being under cooked and the odd flavor the steak wasnt as enjoyable as I hoped.\nThe service was ok this time around  but nobody goes to a Chop House for OK service.\n\nAlthough the manager offered to buy me dessert because of the hair in the salad  I paid for that caesar salad I didnt eat  and that hair remained on my bread plate til I left.\n\nI like Lone Butte and I had a lucky visit to the casino  so my odds on returning to Verona are likely. It's gonna be a roll of the dice to see if they double down with both taste and service next time.
4,Every review I have read is right on!  I had no idea what I was getting into when I stepped foot into this little family owned deli.  Old school - quality meats  great sandwiches.  The sandwiches feed two people for $8.  All I have to say is if you don't try it you are just straight foolish!!
1,Giada has some work to do.\n\n\nFirst   the food here was very good though overpriced for the portion size.  Especially of note was the soup... $10.00 for a portion that couldn't have been more than 3/4 of a cup.  It wasn't lobster bisque where talking about here  it was pasta fagiole.  90% broth with a 5 or 6 white beans.  I am not exaggerating either.   Service is where work is especially needed.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation of our party of 8.  Since we were early  we had no problem waiting in the bar for our table.  They assured us that our table was getting ready.  45 minutes later  30 minutes past our reservation  we were finally seated after several inquiries and several reassurances that the table was almost ready.  What the ????   And to add insult to injury our server in the bar was a dingbat.  Our dinner server was adequate though.  \n\nIf it ever was acknowledged by the staff that we had to wait 30 minutes for table  I wouldn't be so upset.  After all  I know things happen beyond control  but the inconvenience to us was never acknowledged.  An offer of an comp appetizer or drink while we waited would have minimized our irritation.
3,The burger was very good as well as the fries. The menu is creative and diverse. There are many options for getting a good burger on the strip  and this is one of them. I would definitely go back again.
0,Ever since they changed format this station has been downhill...\nits also annoying they play out the same song  in the same hour....\nMaybe its me  I find some of the dj's voices annoying as hell....\n\nand a station that plays the jonas brothers? this world is goin to hell....
1,I got bottom service here for my birthday. The promoter gave us a 2500 minimum quote but when we got to the front a manager approached us rudely and told us we'd have to up our minimum to 3000 or get out. The tab came out to about 4500 after tax  gratuity and some LET fee\n\nManagement and security were very rude. The bottle service girl was very nice and smokin hot. Her name is Lana.\n\nThe club was pretty packed  Calvin Harris was DJing  but overall Hakkasan really needs to work on customer service. \n\nLight is still my favorite club for EDM by far
1,Great barstaff and beautiful atmosphere but the vegetarian food left me wanting more.
3,$10 pizza deal is where it is at!  I haven't had pizza hut in a long long time... I even want to remember the days of the \"Book It\" club where you would read a book in elementary school and you would get a personal pan pizza as a reward (dating myself now).\n\nIt was a Friday night and couldn't think of any options for food that was quick and relatively simple.  I was trying to go meatless that night  so the option of pizza came up.  Heard about the $10 box deal and it comes as a square pizza with 6 rectangular slices (good enough for probably 2-3 people depending on hunger level).  It also comes with bread sticks and cinnasticks.  I know it's carbs galore  but it was great for $10.  I'm not about to do it every night  but it was a good deal for the time.  I even added an order of the pasta since I was curious to see what it would be like to have pasta from Pizza Hut.  The Tuscan chicken Alfredo pasta (minus the chicken) was pretty decent.  Now I just need to try it with the protein in it since it was decent without.\n\nI called in and picked up... so no hitches.  I did notice that the dining room was a bit empty for a Friday night.  The buffet was closed  so I couldn't tell you \"yay\" or \"nay\".
0,The short review....NO.  Don't order here.....\n\nI wasn't bummed out when it took two hours to arrive. (I live 2 miles away)\nI wasn't bummed out when it arrived cold. \nI wasn't bummed out when the delivery kid was a total asshole.\n\nI was pissed when I actually saw my food.  \n\nIf you like receiving a single chicken nugget slathered in Siracha when ordering 1/2 dozen hot wings your gonna love this place. (Literally a single chicken nugget about half the size of a golf ball)\n\nIf you love a measly portion of uncooked pasta and a single piece of meatball (read actual part of a meatball) slathered in store bought sauce  your probably gonna love this place.\n\nIf you like still frozen walmart cheesecake squirted with some kind of strawberry jam  your probably gonna love this place.\n\nThat and the fact that this was stupid expensive....I will continue ordering from Rosattis and more reputable places.\n\nThey did offer to give me a credit  but seriously why would I ever try this again....the service was bad  the food was much worse....
2,Nice selection of rum. Matt was a knowledgeable bartender; a refreshing change. Good music. Unfriendly crowd of mostly guys trying to pick up chicks.
4,I love fish and Alan doesn't  so to find a good restaurant where we can get beef and fish is wonderful. Had the grouper sandwich on Saturday  but had it blackened instead of fried. YUM!!! Moist and delicious. Most restaurants overcook the fish so I was thrilled. Will be having it more often. Alan loves his all beef hot dog and I indulge with my Frozen Margarita. What a great dinner with friends..
0,Don't let the nice outside decor fool you.  Avoid this place like the plague.  Empty tables were everywhere  and yet it took us a good ten minutes to get seated.  We were already antsy by now  but it took our waiter another fifteen minutes to come back and take our drinks  and another two minutes after that to take our order.  Does this sound bad enough yet?  Just wait  it gets worse.  I ordered the fried chicken and waffles  and my girlfriend had the chicken alfredo.  We ordered calamri as an appetizer to share.  The appetizer came out within ten minutes.  Keep in mind this is already about forty minutes elapsed since walking in.  There are alot of waitstaff  but they all seem to just be standing around not doing anything.  We waited for a good twenty minutes before trying to flag down our waiter.  When we finally did  we told her to cancel our remaining order  offering to pay for the calimari only because we had a flight to catch.  The waitress wouldn't let us cancel our order!  We were then forced to wait another ten minutes for our food to come out.  We didn't eat it  paid the bill  and just left.  \n\nPROTIP:  Don't come here.  I should have checked yelp.
2,Great place to go if you don't want to wait for a table at the other food spots.
1,I just left this place with my friend  the only pro is that the waiters were super friendly and the service was fast  got our food pretty quick considering it was busy. We came during happy hour so our drinks were pretty cheap  my friend actually got wasted from all the discounted alcohol. I just got plain chicken tenders and fries  they were good but the honey mustard sauce was too sweet. My friend ordered a steak (medium rare) baked potatoes with a side of broccoli. He said his potato and the broccoli were delicious but his steak was far from medium rare and it had a chewy  plastic consistency. I really don't expect much from Applebee's but I don't appreciate paying 17 dollars for a small steak and having it taste like complete crap.
0,Not a fan.\nSo many people call this a \"goth\" bar.  That couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nTacky decor  rude barstaff  and WAY over priced drinks...\n\nI only went to this bar to support my friend who used to host karaoke there.  Now that he doesn't host  I don't have to torture myself anymore.
3,Thank goodness for Facebook.  A friend of mine posted a picture of what they got here  which is how I heard about this place.  The picture looked so good  I just had to try it.\n\nToday  I got the smokehouse burger for $6.99. The burger came with provolone cheese  bacon  onions BBQ sauce on a sesame seed bun. You can make it a doublestack for $2.00 more.  Thank goodness I didn't  this burger was huge!  What I loved about it was that it was an explosion of flavors.  Thick cut bacon  sweet BBQ  perfectly carmelized onions and a thick patty.  I added on fries which was really simple yet super good.  I've always had a thing for the shoestring type.  These fries were nice and crispy and had just the right amount of salt.\n\nWith the added fries and a drink my total  with tax  came out to $9.48.  ***If you check in on Yelp  you get 10% off your entire bill.  The girl taking my order was cordial. Nothing amazing. \n\nEast Coast Eats is a nice  quaint place. There's autographed jerseys all over the restaurant and 3 TVs playing sports. I like the dark hardwood floors and cherry wood table combination. Overall  this place is clean and simple.  It wasn't busy but totally understandable as it was a Monday.\n\nEast Coast Eats is your typical Boston pizza joint that happens to serve everything under the sun: calzones  pasta  subs  burgers. I do recommend the smokehouse burger.  Great Sunday grub if you're in the Valle Verde area.
2,It was pretty decent but fell short of the other reviews.  If you have had real Chinese food then this is OK.
0,Poor service and was not impressed by the food. Wait staff didn't seem interested when taking our order. I had breakfast  the eggs were burnt and rubbery and the pancakes has sat under the warmer too long and did not taste fresh. Definitely won't be back here
0,NOT impressed. The company talks a good game about being community and family friendly. NOT TRUE.  Have not even tried the food here thanks to their rude staff and arrogant posturing that they are better than others. Don't know about the other locations  but this one on Happy Valley is one I will not be giving any money to.
2,The shop is very nice  presentation is thought-out  and lots of flavors are available. The macarons themselves are ultra sweet  and I didn't like that. Everything else about them was perfect- crunchy shell  soft inside  and generously filled  but the flavors and taste just didn't do it for me. And I bought 10 of them  all different kinds. The only one that I actually enjoyed was the cherry flavor  seemed more authentic tasting than anything else.
4,I've been involved in ordering kegs from Top's for several months now  and I just had to get on and give them props.\n\nThe staff is friendly  they always have what we need  and they take care of us at the drop of a hat.\n\nWe wouldn't be the same without Top's and I would recommend them to anyone in the area!  :-)\n\nThanks Top's!  :-)
0,Terrible!! I just got take out from there and the pizzas barely had cheese and toppings and were super small. Same issues with the salads... It is really unfortunate as they used to put out a quality product. They seemed to have cheaped down everything while keeping the same prices...
1,Nice people  small but dining area was clean. There are some cooked to order items but it's mainly food served up from heating trays  not sure how long it's been sitting out  either.  \n\nGot 3 items off the buffet sat down to eat  took a bite of pancit and it tasted a little off like noodles were spoiled  it smelled that way too. Ended up  throwing away my meal and walking out . I don't think I'll  be back..eww no.
0,I really  REALLY wanted to like this restaurant  support it  and make it a regular fixture in my wife and my restaurant rotation.  I like that it's a family-owned and operated business and that it's right around the corner from my house.  However  I am thoroughly disappointed in Cowgirls.\n\n  My wife and I have been there on three separate occasions.  The first was when they had just opened and the place was packed.  We sat at the bar and had drinks and dinner.  The bartender was very nice and provided good service but the food was over-priced and bland.  We attributed the lack of quality to the restaurant just opening and decided to give it some time.\n\n  The second and third time we went to Cowgirls we ended up walking out after waiting at our table for over 20 minutes without the slightest attention paid to us by any servers in the restaurant.  Both times we entered the restaurant and saw a sign inviting us to \"Seat Yourselves.\"  We found a high-top table in the bar area  sat ourselves  and waited . . . and waited . . .  Multiple times we made eye contact with servers with no acknowledgment from any of them that they would either take our order or notify our server that we were waiting.  The bartender looked in our direction  clearly noticed us sitting and waiting  but failed to send a server over to take our order.  You'd think that in the middle of a recession people working in the restaurant industry would work harder to take care of their patrons.
1,My Wife insisted we try this place because she's really into hot wings. Gotta' tell you.... very  very mediocre. Extremely average. It was a nice atmosphere- It was the last day of the regular hockey season with some important (playoff implication) games going on. Service was really good too... But  Food was really lacking and it was barely OK. To top that  I can't stand when my food is served in a plastic basket! If I'm paying Nine Bucks for a hamburger  at least give me a frickin' PLATE!!!!! Way overpriced  as well.
0,Bought fly fishing lessons for my brother and I and called them prior to booking for a Sunday class.  Said it was fine...and booked a sunday date with them.  They cancelled the class for my day and rescheduled for a few weeks later to be cancelled again.  Now they said they only have Saturday classes that I can book.  Only reason I booked with them was to go on Sunday because of my work schedule Mon-Sat.  They said they'll rebook me when a Sunday class opens up again.  My original booking day was back in Oct 2011  it's been 7months.  Emailed them a few times during that span to see if there are any open spots...all I get is a \"we'll see.\"  So my ratings is based on their availability and flexibility in scheduling.  Gave them an extra 3 months before I wrote this review.
1,It's a little bitter sweet for me here...I just never know what to expect is what i mean by that.\n\nNow I have gone to Lulu's countless times...every time being unique in it's own way  whether it's the food or the service and mostly not in a good way. I can't be a full supporter like most people are because the people that like Lulu's don't agree with my restaurant choices and only think Lulu's is God's gift to Plaza Midwood or to Charlotte at that  and will always put it at the top of they're list to recommend to people!!! That's fine but I really can't take their recommendation on anything else in this town then sorry!! \n\nI came here two Sundays ago and will say that my service and food were both good (this time). It was also 2pm and they were very quiet I assumed we got there after their Brunch rush.\n\nOn all of my other visits here their has always been something wrong the service is my biggest of issues and then the food because one person can get something that is really good and the other person (me) get's something that is not...I'm really not that picky and am very tolerable but for some reason they have some of the worst servers in town (not to offend them)and they have one of the smallest restaurants in town so i think that's what really confuses me how is it humanly possible to not see that we are sitting there and have been w/o anything to drink or with no food for an extreme amount of time. \n\nI still go because like I said its everyone's favorite restaurant so either I dine alone at my favorites or I suck it up and hope for the best and get some mediocre food with some good friends! \n\nAgain for those that LOVE it I'm not knocking you for liking it I'm simply suggesting it not be your #1 suggestion all of the time...  ;)
2,I am going to agree with the review of Juddi L. \n\nThis was a must for my entire family  visitors  business associates  and I  would sing it's praises for years.  I felt it was as good as it gets.   Then  it changed owners.\n\nThe new owner  a Japanese lady  watches every serving and every thing the Chefs do. One by one  the good chefs left. Things got worse;\n\nI was living in Maui  and used to fly back on Hawaiian Air every six weeks. I would send the crew from Hawaiian Air and every Islander I knew  to this place. \n\nOne night  I came in and the owner thanked me for all the people I sent. To reward me  I asked if I could substitute seaweed salad for my Miso Soup  with my Sushimi Dinner. She said  \"That's expensive  and I would have to pay extra\". \n\nBottom line; My son's girl friend called Sushi Mon \"the Mc Donald's of Sushi\".  She was right.  Read my review of Jjanga Japanese Grill. It's better quality  a little less money  and superior quality and service.\n\nAlso  you won't have to wait long for a table or seat at the bar. \n\nThis place has seen it's best days  and now rides on past reputation.
3,Decided to go here since we didn't know Diablos Cantina stopped serving food after 10  I'm really glad we came. The four of us decided on the sirloin medium well and it was delicious. Had a great view from the balcony outside  our server was really on point and super nice. Really enjoyed our meal here.
3,This place is pretty cool. Love the decor and the staff is very friendly. I did get sick after eating here the first time. lol But I am willing to give it another try!
2,I'm a Hilton Honors Diamond member  so I'm obviously super loyal to the brand.  However the Biltmore isn't right for everyone.  If you know what to expect  you can have a fantastic stay  but if you expect the Waldorf=Astoria experience  you will most likely be disappointed.\nPros:\n- the public areas are incredible; the stunning lobby is worth a half hour sit to take it in\n- the pools areas are some of the best in Arizona (which have some of the best in the world)\n- most of the staff seems to be 4 star trained  which is hard to find in the relaxed Arizona resort row\n- the history of the hotel is unmatched in the state. You'll find cool touches in unexpected places (e.g. there's a Nancy and Ronald Reagan registration card with notes about their honeymoon in the room service menu). FLW is everywhere you look.\n- the fitness center is one of the best I've ever seen at a hotel  and it was free.\nCons:\n- MAN are these rooms shabby!  I've stayed several times and toured 4 suites in preparation for a meeting.  All rooms are worn down  but this review is of the last stay in 2126\n- the carpets are worse than frayed  there's actually a crease running the length of the room\n- the two nightstands  table  desk  and TV stand all are warped and peeling motel 6 style\n- the bathtub is worn and needs be glazed or resurfaced\n- the outdated leather headboard had had holes in it\n- every surface is scuffed - even the ceiling!\n- there was one front desk clerk for much of the stay.  Very difficult to get them to answer the phone and/or help with anything\n- no in room coffee.  This a resort practice of the PAST.  High end resorts used to feel fresh coffee brewed from the kitchen was compulsory as single serve coffee makers were brewing substandard watered down cups. Starbucks  Wolfgang Puck  and Lavaza are great brands that the Biltmore should look into..\n\nBasically  if you'll be out of your room the entire stay  this place is great.  If you want a nice room  go down the road to Starwood Luxury Collection's Phoenician: much nicer iconic resort for the same rates.
3,YUM!  Everything we had was good.  There were a few confusions in our ordering b/c it was so loud.  Go with an empty stomach and an open mind.
3,Excellent food  our server was excellent and the lounge has a hip trendy ambience! Had the grilled cheese  tofu dish  asparagus  chopped salad topped with martinis...all of them were very excellent...highly recommend. This is in old town and nice place to get away from the summer heat.
1,The sushi/sashimi combo was pretty good but nothing to rave about. But whatever you do  don't order a hot dish. We ordered the vegetable curry and I'm pretty sure it was squeezed from a bag. The 'vegetables' were small pieces of carrots  potatoes and onions. It was terrible. The service was also a little too quick. We were given our check before we swallowed the last bite. The restaurant wasn't that busy so no need to rush us. Anyway  I'd get sushi elsewhere next time.
0,Straight and to the point--- This place is extremely expensive ($3 for a bagel and cream cheese???)  the staff are a bunch of slow moving \"bros\" who got chin strap facial hair and more product in their hair than in their store. We ordered 2 bagels with cream cheese. Waited about 15mins for a cream cheese bagel?????? Skimped on the cheese big time and messed up one of bagels. .....don't go there. It wasn't busy  so NO that isn't an excuse.
0,Old owners are back so I thought I would try it again. Same lousy food. I picked up the food to go and it was already cold. The tacos had so much grease dripping from them I collected it to change my car oil. SO needles to say I am done with them!
4,Great food  staff is unbelievably nice. Service  is top  no complaints there. Friday/Saturday they have a Dj. Drinks and food specials are stupid good and they don't cut portions down. Hookah is good. Definitely a great stop for anyone just visiting!
1,The employees are friendly but the food itself is pretty bland. The meat and sauce is very unspiced and just doesn't taste Mexican at all. It doesn't even really taste like food actually  its just like chewing a flavorless stick of gum -- you know something is in your mouth  but it doesn't taste like anything at all. The only decent thing was the queso and chips  so you can try that if you absolutely must go here  but I would advise finding a better place if you want Mexican.
4,I love this place!  I have been for breakfast many times  so I have not tried their lunch menu yet.  The food is Fantastic  the prices are great & the staff is always friendly.  They have great healthy options & rediculously delicious UNhealthy options too :) Even when they are crowded  we never have to wait too long.  Plus as a bonus  there is usually a 'BOGO' coupon in the LV Weekly!
3,Giving blood can be a little stressful  but the staff here is pretty cool.  My only complaint is that it takes so long.  I gave double reds for my birthday and it took 2.5 hours from when I walked in the door- and I have big garden hose veins so it wasn't me.  My wife was a little upset because we were going on vacation and it delayed our trip a tad.  But enough about me.  The phlebotemist didn't miss my vein  I got to watch Tremmors on TV and pigged out on cookies and juice.  I highly recommend that you give blood- if not here then somewhere else.
4,Had an amazing experience today!  The 2 members of this team cleaned places that I doubted anyone would notice.  Extremely thorough and friendly.  I will definitely have them clean again and refer others.  Thank you for making my home look and smell beautiful!!!
4,The best sandwiches ever hands down. Try the Capastrami  pastrami  cole slaw  russian dressing and melted provolone. You wont be disappointed
1,I grew up in Phoenix  born and raised on the South-side under the shadow of South Mountain. My family comes from Cuidad Juarez  Estado de Chihuahua and I'm very proud to be Mexican-American. Barrio Caf\u00e9 instantly appealed to me with its creative use of names in the menu and its new school approach to classic dishes.\n\nHowever  this place's reputation is greater than what it can deliver. I had the carne asada tacos and they were average at best. My tortillas were dried out and cracked as I folded my taco. Too much time on the comal I suppose. Carne Asada should be flavorful  it should condense the taste of the beef into tender grilled pieces. This place's meat faded into the background of the cilantro and tomato that buried everything on my plate. The carne asada from my neighborhood carniceria out does this place for far cheaper. \n\nThe drinks were good at least and that is something. The Jamaica was tangy and brewed rich. That is something...\n\nI also didn't appreciate the wait staff calling me a gabacho behind the bar  either. Nice. I'm light skinned not deaf  lads.
3,Party hardy  rock and roll... Love this spot  good junk status bar food and STRONG DRINKS!
3,I was craving a good Italian style pizza & found it at Pino's! Roland was our waiter and he was great. Attentive even when busy. The Caprese salad was phenomenal and the calzone lived up to the reviews. Great find! Nothing fancy but great food.
0,I seriously hate this place because of FOOD POISONING! My co-worker and I decided to pick up some Green Curry w/ chicken for lunch. The lady on the phone was able to persuade me to get the dinner serving for just $2 more. I agreed and when I went to pick up the food I was pretty impressed with how big the containers were because I thought I would be able to save half for dinner. I was very wrong. We barely ate a quarter of it and both of our stomachs started hurting really bad and than later in the day  I threw up. I called Thai Basil after work to let them know and the lady was very rude. She said it couldn't have been their food and it must've been something else that I ate because they just make a big pot for the whole day. I let her know that my co-worker also got sick and she just blew me off. She asked me what I wanted and at that point  I did ask for a refund since she was rude and didn't care. I hate asking for money back but if the customer service isn't there  than I will ask. She said they can only give me half of my refund back and nothing else. I picked up the money the next day and thno one said a single word to me about the situation. They just handed me the money and turned around.
3,Food here was very good. Seemed fresh and the staff were great. It's alot better now then it was when called the Jungle Buffet. I would eat here again and hopefully soon I can.
4,Best Bagel in North America or north of America?\n\nOn a recent visit to Montreal a friend--who just so happens to live there and who could also be considered slightly biased--took me to the bakery who has the \"best bagels in North America\"1.  I paused when he told me that and asked if he meant the best bagels north of America?  Living in the New York area I feel it is blasphemy to call any bagel outside of NYC the best!  I mean  even the bagels I ate daily when I lived in New Orleans were imported from New York City.  We compromised and agreed that St-Viateur Bagel Shop makes the best bagels in Montreal!\n\nSt-Viateur Bagel has been a fixture in Montreal since 1957 when Myer Lewkowicz brought his recipes from Eastern Europe and decided to share them with the people of Montreal.2 They sell over 12 000 bagels a day and the St-Viateur location is open 24 hours.  Everyone wants a St-Viateur bagel!  The line wrapped around the block during my visit.\n\nWhat is the big secret to making the best bagels in Montreal?  There are two key items needed:\n\n   1) Wood-burning oven\n   2) Hand rolling the dough \n\nI am not going to lie  the St-Viateur bagels are fantastic.  A few months ago I discovered the best donuts in Montreal and now I have found the best bagels!  I will let you decide if these are the best in North America or north of America.  I will just say they are pretty darn good and you can be the judge.
0,The beer options are massive  those that have sampled Olive's will be intrigued  but after 3 visits  there's a huge problem-- the service is terrible. One thing that's happened every time I've walked in from Pocket Park  is this dialogue with the hostess were I basically have to spell out that I'm a diner  I would like a table for my party  and we want to EAT HERE. I don't usually walk into a restaurant to sight see. Please please  say hello  ask what I'm here for (a reservation accepted or to be made  or an inquiry about getting seated). DO say hello to patrons. DO NOT text  talk with waiters  then go back to your paperwork duties. It's a constant complaint that has been discused on many blogs  podcasts  and with my friends (3 tries) something's wrong there!  It's weird...I know\n\nAnyway  expect even lesser service at the tables  you'll see some tables get pop corn  huge bread baskets  yours might even be one  but others will get just a quick pass from a waiter saying hello and then asking for an order. Then...prepare to wait. On all three ocassions I've waited at least 45 minutes for the entree. That's rediculous for a PUB. \n\nThe food is okay  the mac and cheese is fine  the bangers and mash consists of bland potatoes and bland sausage  even by english pub standards. The fish and chips is outstanding. The beer selection amazing.\n\nJust know what you're getting into here  this restaurant  after being open over three months does not have it's act together. And  the staff clearly acts like they don't care. \n\nIf you love Todd English (I do) try this place  but otherwise skip it-- it's not in the same class as his other establishments. I'm pretty dissapointed.
3,I eat breakfast here twice a month with a networking group. I've tried a number of dishes and everything has been wonderful. I recommend the spinach/feta omelet.  Coffee is always fresh and good. Service is great.
4,Ruggeri's is a neighborhood gem. It's a small grocer and deli in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood in Pittsburgh. You can go here for anything from basic groceries  to fresh deli meat  to homemade bread. The highlight  though  is in the form of the freshly made sandwiches and the homemade take-home meals. If you don't feel like cooking  Ruggeri's will do it for you  and the food is great! Get the meatball hoagie (a Friday special) or the Italian wedding soup and save the hassle of cooking. Even better  since it's a neighborhood grocer  they'll get to know you when you come there  and they even have some customers on account! Try to find that at Giant Eagle.
3,I had the pleasure of attending a wine tasting here on Sept. 11 2014.  They have a variety of wine on display and the service was great. I purchased some wine on the spot.  I look forward to visiting in the future.
3,It's been a while since I've treated my inner Indian  so I tried this based on yelp reviews. I was not disappointed. Ordered an appetizer of samosas. They were not quite as crispy and bursting with flavor as the ones I remember from my early years In South Africa  but would definitely have them again.\nOrdered the lamb Karma Korma for the entree. I asked for the mild spice  since i don't normally like the really hot dishes  but I probably could have gone with the medium spice. Flavors were well blended with a hint of sweetness. Accompanied it with a side of garlic naan  perfect for mopping up the left over sauce.\nI'll definitely come back again when I'm in town.
1,The worse burgers I have ever had. I ordered a hamburger with everything on it except I asked for no onions because I am allergic to them. They brought it with the onions. Then I waited for 10 minutes for the waitress to come to my table...but she never did. Finally asked another waitress to help. She took the 1st order back and brought me another one without the onions. No flavor what so ever. Well  the original waitress never came back. I did not take another bite of the hamburger. They never apologized and they still charged my husband and I an arm and a leg. Waitress are very rude. Will never eat there again  thats for sure. I rather eat a burger at in and out or burger king....much better flavor and less expensive.
1,Went there for the first time today.  I found the staff to be available and attentive.  It was around 10:30 and very few tables were full. \n\nI ordered a greek salad  without the chicken.  It was good  but small.  When I got the check it was for the full amount of the salad (with chicken) and it was $9.95!!  I inquired about the pricing since I did not have the chicken and the reply from the waitress and the hostess was  that is the price either way.  Okay  I get that  but it was not a lot of salad and for the price I felt it was too much.  \n\nI order things all the time without meat and usually the price is adjusted reflecting the lack of meat. \n\nOh well  just so so and had to go home and forage some more  as I was still hungry.\n\nProbably won't go back.
1,Meh.\n\nI'm not a fan of Italian  but I can eat good Italian.  This was not it.  It felt Macaroni Grill-esque.  The food was heavy and unimaginative.  When I told the waiter I liked Sangria he suggested something not on the menu  I am not joking when I tell you it tasted like a wine cooler.\n\nI'm was thoroughly unimpressed  and shocked that it was so busy.
2,I've found frozen yogurt stores can be hit or miss. \n\nOrange Leaf does a nice job.   Their products aren't too sour  nor tart. -- one of my big concerns.  Their toppings are plentiful and they make an effort to keep things clean  almost to a fault.  \n\nClearly  they aren't perfect  I've been here when they didn't have lids or when the yogurt was runny as others have noted  but they try hard.  \n\nI would easily give them 4 Stars if they could smooth out their rough patches
1,The food is amazing but the service is terrible every time I go there. It doesn't matter what time of day or how slow it is or which server I get. Time to hire a new serving staff.
1,I used to like Mellow Mushroom a lot  it was the flavor of the perfect pizza. But not anymore: last time I visited this place  my pizza was served barely warm after long waiting. It got inedibly cold very quick. Yes  the server was careless: after we ordered  he took one menu  leaving the other on the table. When my drink was almost over  he promised to bring the refill and disappeared. And then showed up to tell us about his intentions again  but no refills. Finally  when we were done with our pizza  I got my drink. Needless to say that waiting for check was very long. \n\nAlso  there was nobody to seat us at the entrance; we've waited for five minutes to get attention. It was amazing considering that there were only few tables with customers.\n\nOh  and the taste of pizza. They changed the recipe for the regular dough  but there is no information about it on the menu. It lack its original sweetness I used to like so much. There is some mention for new recipe for gluten-free crusts  but nothing for regular. \n\nCold-serve pizzas and inattentive servers: Farewell  Mellow Mushroom!
2,Service was nice and friendly  but slow and there was only one other person in the restaurant. The sushi was average  nothing to write home about.
2,Food: Food super greasy and I felt was damaging my health.  My friend ordered hers and did not get noodles with her lo-mein  by the time we came home with our take out order.  \n\nLocation: located in a shopping center next to Harris Teeter.  \n\nPerks: opens on a major holiday when everything else was closed. \n\nOverall  I would not come back...  I knew it was too good to be true to order Chinese food from here. Gah!
1,While the flavor of their BBQ is alright  it seems to stop there. We ordered the rib tips for an appetizer and they were over cooked and tough. I asked for a Medium Rare Burger Bacon Blue Burger and it was medium well and lacking of flavor. There are bottles of regular and spicy BBQ sauce on the table and I'm wondering if someone put the regular BBQ sauce in the Spicy bottle as neither one had any heat at all  which is to bad as I was hoping that they would make the fries better. My partner got a pulled pork sandwich and he said that it was good  though his cornbread was like cake. Also  the servers (it took two and we were the only ones in the place) ideally should not make you feel uncomfortable and have to be asked for silver wear or plates.
4,the food is so  good here  I 'm very  glad that I found this place. My husband and I love the real taste of food . the lady who work there is so friendly.
0,came in at 10:30 waited 10 minutes for someone from the talkative crew in the back to take our order. \na pissed off manager by the name of Alicia comes to the front insisting they've stopped cooking and I insisted we came in 10 minutes ago but no one was willing to even acknowledge us.... while profanity is heard from the kitchen regarding their teenage angst. \n honey I've ordered from pizza Hut five minutes before they close   I'm familiar with the drill. \nafter a brief argument which she lost  she was the utmost reluctant to take my order. bad service and rude faces.
4,I can't say enough great things about this place. Esteban is an amazing therapist. Spend the extra money and get an 80 min Therapie massage. His knowledge and skill is definitely worth the price. I also tried Jen and she is equally as talented. I was exhausted (in a good way) when I left just because she had released so many knots in my body. Sally is one of the sweetest people I've ever met and just as talented as her staff. I sent my girlfriend to her for a breast massage after her mastectomy and she felt so much better after. Do yourself a favor and make your appointment now!
0,I have been a patient of this clinic for years.  much to my dismay the service has become horribly lacking in the past few years.  When calling to make my annual visit  I was told I could not be scheduled to see the Md for 7 months!!  no  that is not a typo  7months!!!  It has been 3 years since I have been hearing that and have being seeing the PA those past few visits  to include a visit in which I had some unusual bleeding and suspected cysts.  I love the MDs and even the PA is friendly and seems very knowledgeable.  I will be taking my women's health elsewhere  to a clinic that answers my calls  is able to schedule me within a reasonable amount of time and handles their business. Everyone is friendly  just can't provide the service required for a health practioner
0,BE WARNED:\n\nI've been told by countless friends and family members  and read tons of Yelp! reviews  that they try and scam you with the \"your windshield is chipped\" business when you pull up. \n\nSure enough  I pull up  and one guy IMMEDIATELY starts inspecting my windshield and comes around to the drivers side window and asks if I do a lot of driving  because there's \"damaging on your windshield that's going to get worse.\" \"It's usually free of charge to fix  depending on your insurance. Who's your insurance.\" I told him \"I'm not sure  my grandparents take care of all of that.\" He responds with \"Well  are you listed on their policy? How do you not know who your insurance is?\" I clearly know who I'm insured by  but wasn't going to give this guy the satisfaction of carrying on this conversation any longer. I shrugged my shoulders and said \"I'm just really spoiled I guess \" smiled and walked away. \n\nSo just be cautious  if you do decide to come here for a car wash  give your windshield a close inspection before hand  then call them out in their bullshit scam. \n\nThe car wash and detail was alright. I could have done it at home  for free  and completed a much more finished job. The steering wheel wasn't cleaned. There was still three visible gum wrappers on the floor  intentionally placed. The back window was only cleaned in the middle  coincidentally where the little Mexican man could reach. There is still residue and everyday-gunk on my windows. \n\nWhat's that saying... Oh yeah; you get what you pay for.
4,Simply  this is my favorite Thai place in Vegas and as a vegetarian  one of the best places for vegetarian delights. My favorite is a special order - Pineapple Fried Rice with basil and shrimp. YUM!!!! I also LOVE the Panang and the Yellow Curry. Extra friendly staff  great food and its off the beaten path  which is a cool thing in Vegas.
3,Location is a real advantage  nice park around  perfect for afternoon walk. \nInside is cosy and warm. Burning wooden logs in the fireplace gives this place real charm and character.
4,I go to this place almost everyday. Love the people there  love the vibe.\nAmazing staff  it feels like home.\nI drink espresso and this is one of the best places to get one on this side of the Atlantic. It's strong  full flavored  aromatic it has everything espresso should have.\nThe ice coffee is to die for in a hot summer day  I didn't know that the ice coffee was this good until I tried Sambalatte's... so much flavor.\nGreat variety of teas as well and many other coffee drinks  all amazing.\nIf you have some work to do you can always hook to the free wifi. There's a huge table for laptops with power plugs so you can work and enjoy your refreshing or relaxing drink.\nAmazing place
1,I came here for the first time they the drive thru--the popolo girl that took my order was rude. She also forgot my coconut bark  so I went in to get it. She had some attitude when I walked in and showed her my receipt. She just kept asking me if it was in the receipt. I said I just went thru the drive through and she repeated it back to me  to which she asked if it was on the receipt that I was showing her-she saw it and gave me the bark with no apologies--just attitude.
3,I think this hotel is awesome and had the most comfortable beds. You get coupons well we did when we stayed and I really liked that. I thought it was really a great hotel because it has more to offer than just a casino. It was clean
4,When the weather permits  meaning no rain  gusty winds  or over bearing dry desert heat  the patio is the spot to be. We had reservations for noon but because we wanted to sit on the patio  it took an extra 15 minutes or so for a table. I highly suggest waiting for it though. It's a perfect place to rock them loccs or douche bag sunglasses while people watching and enjoying the water show across the way at Bellagio.\n\nI had the French Toast ($11) which was topped with whipped cream and blueberries. Man was this entree' dank! The French Toast was made to perfection and the blueberries definitely complimented it. I may have to go out on a limb here and say it's one of the best French Toasts I have ever grubbed on.\n\nI also sampled the Jumbo Crab Cakes ($15) which I thought was very rich but still very well made. It's not an over whelming dish. Perhaps sharing it as an appetizer would be a good idea.\n\nI didn't sample my other table mate's dishes but I can say that everyone in my party had positive reviews. All of us agreed that everything we ordered was awesome. No complaints on that day.\n\nWith all the many years I have been coming to Sin City  I can't believe I have barely experienced Mon Ami Gabi for the first time. I feel somewhat shameful. I've seriously been missing out on some great and affordable French food. I can't comment on their dinner yet but perhaps next time under them city lights. \n\nAu Revoir!
4,Being from New Orleans I love snowballs. This was my 1st time here and it is a home run. They use a southern snow machine and they know how to use it. The ice was perfect snow consistency. They had condensed milk which is a must. Very friendly service and the syrups are good. On par with snow ono and better than the others. I will be back soon.
3,Great concept and food. Went in for the first time tonight and got the falafel pita with eggplant and couscous. The falafel was better than most places in town but seemed to fall apart a little too easily. Will definitely be back here
4,This place has been shut down.
4,Yep  the portions are as big as your head but that should not be something that's bad. Ever heard of a doggie bag? \n\nAnyhow  in a town full of corporate fast food chains  HHaGo Go is a breath of fresh air. They have a nice coffee bar and nice breakfast drinks as well as thoughtful dishes. I had an omelette with sun dried tomatoes  goat cheese  and herbs. The dish was light  fluffy  flavorful and not greasy. They also offer a thoughtful children's' menu with some non-typical and traditional dishes for variety. \n\nIf the portions are too big go to McDonald's! \n\nI'll give it five stars because it is different and thank goodness in a town of Carl Jr's.
4,I live in North Scottsdale and it's worth driving all the way down here. Dr Oswald is excellent  as is the whole staff. Scheduling/billing and everything else is a breeze. They've taken care of some things that my previous dentists have let slide. I've gotten a couple of onlays and filling replacements that are working out much better. Highly recommended!
0,Total dump!  I'm sure some people are happy with it just because it's so cheap but it's not worth it at all.  It's located way off the beaten path at the very end of the strip.  The area seems completely unsafe.  The monorail stops nowhere nearby.  If you want to see the American Superstars show be prepared to wait on the same insane line as the tower attractions.  My girlfriend and I showed up 45 minutes before showtime and decided not to go to the show because the line seemed like it would last at least an hour.  The room was every bit as tacky as a run down truckstop motel.  All in all the hotel is very depressing.  I know people are always going to love something if it's cheap but staying at this hotel completely jips you out of having a true Las Vegas experience.  If you're going to be this cheap with yourself why even bother going to Las Vegas in the first place?  This hotel is shit hole and it's way too far from the nice part of the strip to even be remotely worth considering.  Avoid at all costs!
4,Dr. Singer has a nice  gentle way of fixing your neck and back pain. She couldn't be any nicer and treats you like family. She really makes sure you understand your problem and ultimately ordered a MRI  which said exactly what she had already told me. I wish that I would not have procrastinated so long. Thanks Dr. Singer.
2,It wasnt as bad as i thought.  rooms were big  comfy  nice bathroom  check in fast  room service fast and very cheap  next to the gay clubs which is a plus  and its affortable.\nThe bad part of the hotel is it is not a resort so i dont know why its called a resort.  Its an outside hotel not an inside hotel  no casino  it is a big property almost like apartments. there were a ton of ghetto people that stayed there throwing parties in their rooms which didnt bother me to much because it is vegas but it does get annoying after a while when you stay there for 3 days and its hotel parties everywhere in the complex.
4,Just had the butternut squash soup yesterday for lunch and it was delicious  not at all too sweet.  If you end up going to Club Sandwich  be sure to ask about the daily specials before you decide on something from the normal menu.  The specials are surprisingly current and interesting dishes  which isn't something I would expect to find in Sharpsburg.
2,Basic burger and onion rings were good not great. Decent meal if you're at the Mirage but otherwise I'd look for another option if I was inclined to go elsewhere.
1,Since moving to Vegas from New York City I have really struggled to find great food at reasonable prices.  I've always heard people say \"youre so lucky to live in nyc they have the best food!\" but I never believed the talk until I left.  I have been really disappointed with most of the food out here.  It seems that unless you want to spend a ton of money most meals are just mediocre I found the same was true at Ichiza.\n\nWalking in  I liked the atmosphere- busy  lots of locals  a little choatic  I was prepared to have a great meal after all the fantastic reviews.  The first two dishes we had- seaweed salad and garlic stir fried bok choy were probably the best things we ate all night.  They were simply prepared and the indgredients fresh.\n\nWe moved on to the broiled butterfish which was way too greasy to finish.  The sushi- which we were especially looking forward to is about the quality one would find in a NYC supermarket.  The avocado in my spider roll was browning and the crabmeat was not fresh.  The tuna and spinach roll was fine but the fish was nothing very memorable.\n\nMaybe I've learned my lesson- youve gotta drop some cash to eat well in Vegas.  And steer clear of fish in a land locked state!\n\nI would not go back and anyone who appreciates fresh fish and ingredients will stay away.
0,No  no  no  no... my family stayed here for 1 week because my younger cousin did not want to stay at Caesar Palace with boring old people is what he claims. Worst decision ever we should have gone to Ceasar's and my aunt and uncle should have stayed there. When we got to our room  they told us it wasn't clean and we needed to wait 3 more hours  when they finally let us in I decided to take a shower and the shower head was not working! I found a cockroach inside the nightstand  and the worst part was me and my brother had a separate room  what a big mistake that was at 2:00 am these two men were banging on my door drunk saying they were going to kidnap me they didn't leave till 2:30 and I had called the concierge telling them what was happening the security never showed up! The main reason we stayed at circus circus was my cousin wanting to have fun and go in the adventure dome  he got bored after one day he said the rides were dirty and stupid he was (12) at the time. Oh word of advice  outside the Adventure Dome they sell these \"MAGICAL\" fuzzy worms that are like $40 don't buy them they come with a string and don't work they ripped my brother off. Never coming here again!
1,Honestly  I've been here before and I really enjoyed it the first time; but this last time....how do you keep running out of fried chicken?  Ahh...when I did have the opportunity to taste the fried chicken  it was like home cooking.  So crunchy  just the right amount of seasoning...truly grubb'n!  Now  I wonder if that was fluke  since the katsu was ok and my husband's tapsilog did not hit the spot.  \n\nThe saving grace was the Adobo fried rice omelet.  sorry  that's what's up with this spot.
3,I dont normally like pancakes.... but I love Babystacks. Bless them for adding a Henderson location! They have a very diverse menu. Just know their bacon is turkey bacon. They even have cookie butter french toast! Treat yo self  by coming here for breakfast!
3,Hands down - Kabob Grill has the best hummus in town! This review is for the Stonecrest location. The service and food is great and consistent. Some of my favorites are the kibbeh (who doesn't like football shaped food filled with meat?) Nabeel's salad  and the chicken kabobs.  The entrees come with two sides  I recommend the potato hara and the hummus - they are both really  really tasty.
3,Good variety of delicious smoothies!\n\nTip:  You can order your smoothie \"skinny\" which means they don't add sweetener. According to the nutrition guide  this saves you 100 calories and 24 grams of sugar.
4,A wedding rehearsal dinner group had an amazing time here! Wow- I really loved it! A lot- anyone having a wedding at the Aria or a nearby hotel should DEFINITELY consider having a reception here! So we had a room in the restaurant that I wish I would have photographed so that others on here could see. It was super nice  elegant but not stuffy. It was perfect for the dinner. We had around 3 dozen  but my guess is you could probably add another dozen or two. \n\nThe food was awesome. A few appetizers and pizzas were selected for the tables and were all very good. The pizzas were particularly excellent!! I would definitely come back here just for the pizza. Most everyone enjoyed there meals or loved their meals that came afterward. The only ding I would give them is that the drinks were a bit on the very weak side; however they tasted fantastically!\n\nThe bride mentioned how easy it was for her to work with the staff to make this event happen  and they decided to go with WPP&C on a last minute change of plans and they worked with them seamlessly. \n\nI will definitely head back here next time I am in Vegas  which is often  and will tell friends!!
1,I really wish that they could come up with something new and exciting. Once I saw the first Cirque show  all the others are just...boring. I guess it's true when they say  you've seen one  you've seen them all. Except...the sand painting was great! And innovative.
2,We were here for their lunch buffet. The chicken tendori? was very tender. Coconut dessert was good. Everything was bit too salty.
1,First  their system is way to slow. I went in for lunch yesterday and there was only one other person in front of me. He ordered three burritos and each time they would make a single tortilla and make the burrito  then go back to the start and make a second tortilla and the second burrito  back to the start and make the third tortilla and third burrito. Even the guy that was being helped was embarrassed by how long his order was taking to make. They should have made all three tortillas at the same time and made the burritos at the same time which would have been much faster.\n\nSecond  I must not be ordering the right thing as I went back yesterday to try it a second time since I did not enjoy the first time I went and again  wasn't impressed.\n\nI had the sweet pork burrito the first time which was way to sweet. Yesterday I had the chicken burrito with red sauce and the red sauce was all I could taste. I love Chipotle and their burritos are much better than what I had here.\n\nMy wife and kids also remarked that Chipotle is much better.
1,2 stars because they gave us really cheap vodka and tried to pass it off as what we ordered.  none the less...we got trashed here...horrendous headache later (thanks to the cheap vodka).\n\ndon't think i'd go back...it was an ok place to get trashed but if my tab at the end of a 4 hour drinking spree with my boyfriend is gonna be over a hundred bucks...i want decent vodka and not have to worry that we'll get thrown out for using the \"eff\" word at the blackjack tables by the bar...yes  harrah's tossed him out for saying \"f**k\"
1,We met friends there for lunch.  I had the the shrimp tacos.  I believe the shells were preformed safeway brand  absolutely no taste.  The meal itself was mediocre.  Our friends suggested the place most likely due to the skanky waitresses that worked there.  Sorry for being blunt  but really....  My wife had the chicken wraps and let me WARN you.  If you like tasteless grilled chicken strips and very narrow lettuce strips with not to much flavor  you will absolutely love these  if not don't order you will be as dissapointed as my wife was.\n\nOur friends are starting to warm up to Yelp.com.  We should have yelped before going  had we  we would have suggested another place  like Pinks hotdogs.
0,On our annual guys trip (we are all thirty-something guys) we went to Public House last year.  Everyone absolutely loved it  even my one friend who is an extreme foodie and does not like most places we pick out.  So everyone was wanting to go back this year.  We had an 8:30 Sunday reservation so it was not crowded.  Due to a few people stuck at a Black Jack table we had a party of 5.  It took forever to get our server to initially stop by the table (at least 10 minutes).  Then our drink order took forever to get to our table.  There were not that many tables filled in the restaurant.  When we finally got to order we ordered our entrees and some of us ordered a salad or an appetizer.  After 30 minutes we still had not received even our salad or appetizer.  My friend who used to be a server at several fine dining restaurants was getting a little impatient at how ridiculous the ticket time was taking.  He kindly asked the server for a manager.  It took her a bit to come over (tall  skinny African American younger woman)  but when he explained the situation saying our server was super nice  but he clearly must be drastically in the weeds since it was taking him forever for the drinks and that we had not seen any food.  She did not seem to care one bit  she seem unapologetic  and said she would check on it.  When she came back after awhile  she said it would be coming  what the heck does that even mean?  My buddy said just bring us the check we were leaving (we were there for over an hour at this point with only one round of drinks to show for it the second round had not even gotten there).  She said okay  attempted no customer recovery.  When she brought the check  she had overcharged us by $25!  I was so disgusted on how terrible this place has become in just a year.  I will never go back and on my way out I told 4 different parties walking in how bad this place was  I at least got one to turn around.
3,I do not actually know why Mellow Mushroom left the Charlotte market a few years ago - but whatever the reason  they seem to be doing a bang-up job this time around.\n\nThis location on Selwyn was handing out slices - for free no less - but they still managed to have a crowd that was waiting to get in.  They must have been waiting for something other than cheese or pepperoni pie.\n\nLike everyone else  we waited for our table  and were oh-so-glad when the food came out.  We chose the red potato pie (or something along those lines).  Think of a loaded baked potato spread out on a pizza crust and you will get the idea.  Talk about tasty!\n\nOther than the wait and the prices that others have mentioned  the only real downside to the experience was the appetizer.  We tried some of their pretzels  and they seemed to be made of the same dough as the pizza crust.  Not surprising  but they just were not as good as a good sourdough pretzel with a hard crust on it.  You might want to skip these and save room for the pizza instead.
0,I can honestly say I'm baffled as to why this place has such great reviews.  I honestly thought that I was in the wrong place at first.\n\nWe decided to go to dinner here based off of the reviews and boy were we disappointed.  We were barely greeted by the host/waitress and told to just pick a table wherever we wanted.  We waited several minutes for someone to come with a menu  and when they did they just dropped them off and didn't say anything.  While reviewing the menu  they brought us some water and asked if we were ready.  We decided to order the Rolled New York (because of all the rave reviews) and Rigatoni alla Vodka. \n\nWe were basically the only people in the restaurant and the food still took forever.  The brought us bread with our drinks  and this was probably the saving grace of the entire meal.  When our food finally arrived  I was severely underwhelmed by how bland the Rigatoni alla Vodka was.  For what the sauce lacked in flavor  they seemed to try and compensate it with black pepper.  To top it off  it was way overpriced and not worth it one bit.  Every bite felt like I was eating a forkful of pepper...horrible.  The Rolled New York was nothing to write home about and the steak part was overdone.\n\nThe atmosphere was very casual and I could see why families and big groups would like coming here  as they wouldn't have to worry about behaving kids or loud conversation.  \n\nNeedless to say  we probably won't be returning here for another meal.  Service was subpar  as was the food.
2,I love this place. Just traveled from mt charleston and they were closed at 6:30!!! Hope they're not out of business
4,Remember this is 5 stars by Madison standards  not by Chicago standards.\n\nSo  I really like the fried rice  the panang  and other coconut style curries  nothing here is bad so far  just some are better than others. Satay works for me  as do triangle curry appetizers. Tried some of others  and once again not bad  just not good enough for me to get over and over again.\n\nIf you want decent Thai in Madison this is a great place to go  we always carry out  it's more of joint than a restaurant.
4,My husband has been raving about this place for months and I finally went today.  I kept thinking  its just hot dogs  what is the big deal?  But I was thoroughly impressed and I will definitely go back.  The owner and cook were friendly and our food came out quick and just as we ordered.  My husband is one of the pickiest eaters on the planet  so the fact that this place has him eating sweet and savory flavor combos on a hot dog is enough to warrant 4 stars  and the fifth star is just because it was so darn tasty.
3,I was pleasantly surprised by Magnolia's. It doesn't look like much  but we had a great meal there. The Four Queens gave us a buy one get one entree coupon for signing up for their players club  so me and my boyfriend each got the \"fried neptunes platter\". Whoah. It was A LOT of food. Two large fried fish filets  two large crab cakes  three large fried tiger shrimp  mashed potatoes  salad  tartar sauce and some other chipotle-esque sauce. It was very yummy and a really good value. We stuffed ourselves and couldn't finish our meal. Service was also very friendly. If you want some casual seafood on the fly  check it out.
0,The food is ok  nothing spectacular. I did like the wings however; I will never return. The service was awful! Rude wait staff is completely unacceptable!!! Even if the food had been phenomenal ( which it wasn't )  with horrible service I would never return. Boo Taps! Your staff sucks! We walked in and were practically scowled at. The waitress looked annoyed to answer any of our questions and take our order. It is not like she was busy  there was only one other table with two people at it. And  to top it all off she practically threw my change on the table after paying the bill. If you like piss poor service  Taps is the place for you!
3,This airport is just about always busy - and that can be a little annoying. Wanna walk from point A to point B? Well  don't be in a hurry  because there are 5 million (slight exaggeration) people in your way.\n\nBUT  they have decent restaurant options  and plenty of them. On top of that  the people in the international area are about as nice as they can be: One of them actually called me \"sweetie\". I almost broke down crying because it was so nice to be treated so well after spending several months out of the country. I am telling you... the customer service in the United States is beyond. And the CLT is top notch!\n\nAdditionally  the airport is pretty small  all things considered. I was at the very end of terminal B when I arrived. Had to head to D  which was the opposite side of the airport. I think that with all the foot traffic  it took me a whopping 10-15 min. Not too shabby... but I will admit that I am a master maneuverer  and walk with relaxed-looking lightning speed. So maybe add a little extra time for the lollygaggers. Nice thing is there're some little shops there in the middle. Relax  check it out. Then be on your merry way.\n\nOH! One last pointer: AWESOME place to come in internationally... it took me like 3 seconds (again  slight exaggeration) to get through customs. There were plenty of lines  re-entering through security was also well-organized. It honestly is THE best place (and I've been through a lot of airports internationally) I have ever been when re-entering the US of A. Highly suggest making this your international airport (when possible).
0,I've always had a mediocre experience here and today was no exception. I went in just to get my polish removed- regular polish  not gel. The gal told me it would be $5 which I thought was crazy but did it anyways because I needed my dark polish taken off so badly  but when I went up to pay the guy charged me $7. It literally took her 1 minute to remove my polish- $7- wtf? So ridiculous. I will not be coming here  ever again  and would not recommend that anyone else does either  unless you want to pay a ton for very basic service.
1,Just another overpriced Scottsdale restaurant where more money was spent on decor than food creation  and beauty in the servers is clearly more important than the service itself. We ended a progressive dinner here on my birthday and it was the worst experience ever. During our visit  the only thing they had to accomplish was taking drink orders - as the cold  bland  dry  gross cupcakes were already on the table in the gorgeous private room. We had an hour allocated and weren't served drinks until 10 minutes prior to our departure time. While the manager (or someone) did reach out via Twitter (a kudos) the bottom line is that the experience was so bad that no one in our group would even consider returning if it were free. Don't be fooled by yet another restaurant that is pretty  but sucks. Go enjoy overpriced dining somewhere that can deliver a whole experience. You owe it to yourself.
4,Excellent selection of yeasts  malts and hops and all kinds of random cleaners  enzymes  additives and other stuff that I have no idea what it is. If it's for making beer or wine  they have it. Only encountered one time when they didn't have a Lacto strain I wanted and they ordered it for me and called me when it was in. \n\nPrices seem pretty standard for homebrew shops. They don't skimp on ingredient quality just for a little bit lower price  and they aren't ripping anyone off either.\n\nBring in (or email them) your own grain bill or come in and tell them what kind of beers you like and they will help you out  or you can just take a look through their recipe books. I made their Pumpkin Porter last year and everyone I know liked it more than Four Peaks'.\n\nThey always answer any questions I have  are always friendly and don't even mind me tasting a few grains of different malts to see the flavor difference between them.\n\nHighly recommend. Like getting homebrew supplies (that you have to pay for) from a friend.
2,I wandered into this place to buy *something* and was greeted by some very friendly people who looked like they had just stepped out of movie. Sort of a cross between.... Deliverance and... Pulp Fiction.\n\nNICE people just... um .... well.... gosh... I think they're local Las Vegans who've been here a long long long time.\n\nThey have every color flogger you can imagine but the quality is only fair. No rubber clothing and the leather stuff was pretty run-of-the-mill stuff. This is not the place to come to if you're used to seeing San Francisco/ NYC/ Chicago fetish wear. The fashions here are straight out of a catalog.\n\nConsidering the limited options one has in Las Vegas for BDSM stuff  this place has a pretty good selection. I would guess that their clientele is going to be people who are fairly new to the scene. They have all the staple books by Jay Wiseman and Midori and other Bay Area folks... it's a good place to go for basics. I'd look elsewhere for custom or more expensive items.
2,Ummm  I got sauce on half of my dinner.  I ordered Sesame Chicken which was probably the worst sesame chicken I have ever had.  It's hard to make it bad but this sure wasn't good.  And I got a box 3/4 full of white rice.  I am not impressed with what I got for the price  by any means.  Won't eat here again but my belly is full tonight.
4,Another great meal  this time with a couple of friends. Our friends are newer to sushi on a whole but they were blown away by the creative things KC setup for us. We tried a few new things and my friends had a white tiger roll amongst many  other rolls. \n\nI think they just found their new honey hole for sushi. I was happy to take them.\n\nHospitality again was bang on  service as we needed anything  I normally drink their cold green tea and I never was without. Saba  again was perfect and flavorful - we had more sashimi this time. Everything was flavorful and tasted fresh. \n\nHere is the kicker with this place. For sushi  in the valley it is really reasonable. We have other choices in the Surprise / Glendale area but for my money and either way I have to drive somewhere to get sushi  they get my business. They have the right combination of not being too big  not having too many crazy rolls (he does make creative things but he doesn't have 10000 rolls  and almost all of them are NOT DEEP FRIED) and really good quality fish.\n\n It is an intimate experience in a small restaurant with people that really value you being there. I think in the last month I've been there 4 times and they always make us feel like we're guests in their home  and they serve us with such care you just want to go back.  Little touches like mocchi after the meal  light salads to start  heck this time the sweetheart even gave us a bottle of sake to take home with us  as a thank you.\n\nThey have set a really high standard that I hope they can keep. It definitely seems like they have all of the kinks worked out and they are definitely firing on all cylinders. \nAlso  it was a tuesday  after 8pm  and the place was steady with take out orders and table orders. A very good sign.\n\nKeep up the excellent work  we'll be back next week :)
0,I'm not sure what has happened here  but to say there has been a food quality nosedive is putting it mildly.  Used to be a great stop for pub food  bring the kids and so forth.  The last two trips have turned us off completely.  Teenage son wouldn't touch his poutine.  Fish and chips have gone from one of the better to the absolute worst imaginable.  They look  feel and taste like they are coming out of a grocery freezer section.  Just terrible and a shame because the ambiance is great.  Service not so great.  Drink orders arrived after we finished our food! Unbelievable.
0,I visited this establishment with a group of friends  all of whom love burlesque and I should say that the ladies that perform here are wonderful.  The management  was terrible. After several avoidable errors involving our group  the manager on duty was not gracious  well meaning or polite.  \nAlso this isn't a \"burlesque club.\"  It is a lousy regular club which employees a few talented performers.  \nI would not go here again or recommend it to anyone for any reason.
2,This restaurant will find no shortage of rave reviews.  They know most people come here to celebrate a special occasion.  The beautiful Pittsburgh skyline at night  is an amazing backdrop for dinner.  And the staff is excellent in complementing the evening with friendly service.\n\nThe $70/per chef's tasting was pretty good.  Each selection  apps  fish  meat  and desert have 3 choices  so if you're with another person  you'll likely get 2 out of 3 dishes offered.  Some of the flavor profiles were pretty great  but a tad salty for our tastes.  One of our fish dishes was the Cobia  and we sent it back because we thought it was still frozen.  We're not sure - we were told it was cooked to medium-rare  but we couldn't even cut through the fish - and it was ice cold in the middle.  So I still don't know if it wasn't cooked right  or we just don't know how to eat Cobia.  \n\nSome other hiccups in the service  included the wrong glass of wine  and actually the wrong meat course.  I had ordered the lamb but got the short rib.  I didn't say anything about the short rib  because  c'mon  who doesn't love short rib? Regardless  that many mistakes from such a high-end restaurant is surprising and disappointing.\n\nWe still had a very pleasant experience  but I think felt a little wanting for more of a wow factor from the food.  \n\n------------\nAppetizer - Choice of One\nScallops - Nantucket Bay Scallops  Diver Sea Scallop  Cauliflower  Breadcrumbs\nParsnip  Leek & Ginger Soup - Toasted Pepitas  Pumpkin Oil\nRicotta Ravioli - Hedgehog mushrooms  Black Truffle  Hickory Smoked Chanterelle Puree\n\nFish Course - Choice of One\nNorth Atlantic Lobster - Melted Leeks  Red Beets  Mascarpone Risotto\nCobia - Kale  Shiso  Pickled Ginger  White Soy & Yuzu Ponzu \nBass - Roasted Brussels sprouts  Golden Beet  Agro Dulche Buerre Blanc \n\nIntermezzo - Chef's Daily Sorbet Selection \n\nMeat Course - Choice of One\nVenison Rack Chop - Black Pepper Crust  Spelt Berries  Persimmon  Roasted Fennel\nNY Strip Steak - Salsify  Celeriac Puree  Malbec Reduction  Demi\nSmoked Duck Breast - Pumpkin Cavatelli  Confit of Leg  Celebration Squash  Sage  Huckleberry \n\nSalad\nOrganic Arugula Salad - Pears  Candied Pecans  Meadow Belle Goat Cheese  Apple Cider Vinaigrette \n\nDessert - Choice of one \nMeyer Lemon Bar - Poppy Seed Cr\u00e8me Brulee  Raspberry  White Chocolate  White Corn Shortbread \nOlive Oil Cake - Petite Rhubarb  Blood Orange Ice Cream  Chocolate Balsamic\nChocolate Ganache - Organic Chocolate  Campfire Marshmallow  Graham Cracker Ice Cream
2,Pretty large portions at this spot.  It was only my first time  so  I have to come back and try more dishes.\n\nHar gow = fresh  good size  and tasted good.\n\nFried Meat Ball = huge here.  A little more of a tang to the meat  but the outside fried mochi was nice  thick  and oily; just the way I like it.\n\nShrimp wrapped in big noodles = wasn't warm enough; and didn't taste fresh.  Not enough sesame oil\n\nPreserved Duck Egg & Pork Porridge = a little on the thin side  i like my porridge thick  but flavorful w/ no soy sauce needed.\n\nPork buns = yuck  not too my taste at all!\n\nI will be back to try more!  This place is a fairly large establishment where you are able to come and not have to wait very long.  Although  I did come on a weekday  so I'll have to check it out on the weekends; probably on a Sunday.  Will let y'all know!\n\nYelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (42/365). I have a lot of catching up to do!
2,I have been here quite a few times and each time have had a different experience:  good  then bad  then so-so  which consistency for me is key. I want to go to a place where I at least have a certain level of desirable expectation. \n\nA few girlfriends and I went here last night (Monday)  mainly because Monday's they have half off bottles of wine  can't beat that! \nI love the ambiance  low lighting  candles  decor is much older feeling  heavy metal chairs  wood tables  stone counter tops. . . kind of a picture perfect place. So you have two constants- good wine (half off or not) and a nice atmosphere for a date or a girls night  but something always seems to give with either service or quality of food. \n\nLast night our server was great  but food was disappointing  my entree- Eggplant Parmesan came out luke-warm and my girlfriend's salad was soaked in dressing. \n\nSo you are probably thinking why would I give them three-stars and that's simply because I am not just basing it on last night. I think some simple quality control steps with food and service and it could easily be 4 or 5 stars!
0,This place immediately got one of our drink orders wrong. We asked for a Thai coffee with boba  and two minutes later a coffee with no boba came out. No big deal though. Not too long after our waiter tipped over my glass of water into my lap  where my phone was laying  and it died. I asked to talk to the manager and in a rude tone he asked  \"well what do you want me to do about it\"? I mean  I sat in your restaurant with cold  wet pants and I don't at least get a free drink or meal? Nope  just a meaningless \"sorry\". Too bad sorry doesn't fix my iPhone. But hey  the food was good.
0,This place has gone completely down the toilet. Went there with my wife for Mother's Day and they ruined the day. The server Thomas was dense  like he was on drugs. An appetizer was supposed to come with the meal - that never happened. Talked to the manager about it. He apologized and promised a free dessert. The bill came and I was indeed charged for the dessert.\nBeware  don't go there until they start drug testing! Your money will be better spent anywhere else. They were once good  no more. Crack is Whack Genghis Grill!
4,I LOVE WETZEL'S PRETZELS.  My husband and I will come to the mall specifically for Wetzel's and nothing else. We'll make up an excuse to go to the mall and then be all like  oh yeah  and let's get a pretzel while we are there. We always get the bitz and they are so soft and fluffy. Lately the ones on the bottom don't seem to get as much butter love as the ones on top  but that's what I save the pizza sauce for.
1,Ok Teharu..... it took nearly 40 minutes to be seated. Had we been called as our name appeared on the sign up sheet  it would have only been about a 20 minute wait. \nYou can't have a guy that speaks little english in charge of seating people if he is going to skip them/ and or give away the table to another party. \nThis was not an impressive visit. Better luck next time.
1,If five pieces is all you can eat for 19.95 then you are good. However with a limited selection for all you can eat and a smaller section of rolls this is not what is advertised. $1 charge for left over pieces too. Must be a tough market.
0,The office has the worse front desk staff and billing  ever experienced. The wait is almost always a minimum of 2 hours. They do not bill according to insurance and overcharge on copays. The office manager Chris is very rude and negative and should go to charm school. Unfortunately  the staff make the office a terrible place which is sad because Dr. Nakamura is a good doctor. I would not recommend and seek alternatives if at all possible. Two Thumbs Down
0,This place was awful. We went on a busy Sunday in March  granted shortly after their opening  but being a chain  the opening should go well you'd think. The service was non-existent after our drinks were brought. The food was just meh. This place caters to the East Coast tourists visiting the mall. Don't waste your money.
0,The cafe has the worst customer service ever including a not so friendly staff. We ordered a grilled cheese and a shake. After waiting for 15 minutes (mind you the place was dead)  the girl brings our shake to us stating that she forgot about it. No mention of the grilled cheese  we walked up to the counter and asked the status on that order. The girl look puzzled and stated that she burned our sandwich and would make a new one. The panini press is in plain site  and no sandwich was ever made to be \"burned\". The manager was on the side of the cafe making a drink  then brought it out to a girl outside of the establishment. We highly don't recommend this place  unless you like waiting for your food that will never come  and like to experience some of the worst customer service.
4,I was in desperate need of a haircut yesterday and hopped on Yelp to look for a good barber in the area I was in.  There were a number of 4 and five star rated shops  but for some reason the reviews for Cliff's stood out.\n\nI think my hair is pretty easy to cut (very short)  but for some reason  I haven't been able to find a good barber in the 15 years I've lived here.  I think my search is over.  Cliff was super friendly and gave me exactly what I asked for.  In fact  he knew what I wanted before I told him.  Cliff seems to be a really good guy and the shop is very unique.  You won't find another shop like it.  He also has really good hours: 8am to 7pm seven days a week.  Regardless of your schedule  you could be able to make it in.\n\nIf you're in need of a new barber like I was  give Cliff's a try.
3,very good and healthy at reasonable price
1,Sandwiches are ok but wilted warm lettuce is gross.  \n\nThe employees are bored and can't be bothered to even fake a smile--both at the point of ordering and the cashier.  They also mixed up my order with other customers' orders twice.\n\nGet them a tip jar and they may be able to fake it for the length of their shifts.
0,We went to Silk Elephant after partaking in a movie.\n\nOrdered the Mussels and discovered it came with 2 mussels and all filler.  I requested a second order without the filler.  Literally  a single bowl of 2 mussels came out.  \n\nFor the prices  portions (even considering it's tapas) are pathetic.
3,You can't beat the down home cooking at the Cafe.  Every night there is a new dinner special all for under 7.99.  Stuffed cabbage on Monday   lasagna and steak in Tuesday  best catfish in the west on Thursday.  No ambiance.  It is all about home style food at affordable prices.
3,Went here on a trip to Vegas and man was the food good! I love Tapas but usually always see a $100 bill each whenever I go. Not here!\n\nAll the tapas are $4.50-$8 each and the drinks were reasonable too. The result - 6 items and drinks for under $50 for the two of us!\n\nWe had:\nChicken Empanadas - my favorite dish  flakey and full of flavor; a lot lighter than a typical empanada. Excellent.\n\nTuna Tartar - not the best tuna I have eaten but for $8 it was decent for the price\n\nBacon wrapped almond fig - okay no the official name but you will see the one I am talking about it. If you like bacon order it. The perfect blend of salty and sweet. Has a bit of blue cheese and a balsamic type sauce. Very good.\n\nApple and Manchu Salad - really awesome. a light and yummy summer salad. I love the fresh green apple cut julian with the almost-blue-cheese. \n\nGarlic bread with almond butter - the free dish was probably the most unique. I need to know where they got the almond butter from because it was like nothing I have ever tasted. It was galic meets peanut butter  but not. It looked and spread like butter but tasted creamer. So good.\n\nDessert - Gelato Trio - 3 excellent flavors: chocolate  vanilla and my favorite the pistachio.\n\nSangria it was the sparkling white one aged for 3 days; very good for a hot summer day\n\nNo this wasn't the quality of San Fran tapas but it gets 4 stars for being cheaper than eating at the Olive Garden and excellent food. I will be back on my next trip to Vegas.
0,If I could give this Jamba Juice 0/5 stars I would. I generally like this location  however today the staff changed that. The staff was uneducated regarding their policies  unable to resolve an issue or even attempt to do so. I got the response \"I just work here\" Everyone I encountered looked miserable. No one smiled or seemed upbeat. The guy that poured my smoothie asked me how my day was and I told him \"horrible\" (considering what I had just dealt with when purchasing the smoothie) The guy respond after I said \"horrible\" he stayed quite and looked down as if not knowing what to say. Someone please tell me what kind of costumer service is that and who is training these kids? The smoothie itself was awful tasting. I buy the same smoothie every time and I know what it's supposed to taste like and what I received today was nothing close to it. It did not taste fresh or sweet. It's one thing to have an awful tasting smoothie and you deal with it because the staff is awesome and you leave with a smile on your face. BUT it's another thing when the costumer service is just as bad if not worse then that awful smoothie. Overall a horrible experience from the lack of costumer service to the disgusting so-called fresh fruit smoothie. I will not be returning to this Jamba Juice location for many reasons and will recommend my friends and family do the same.
1,If I could do 2 1/2 starts I would.\n\nI ordered here for lunch one day  as they deliver and I was the only one at work so I couldn't leave to grab food. There is a minimum $15 dollar order for delivery order as well as a $1.50 delivery charge. This isn't bad considering the low min. order amount  however  their menu prices are so cheap that you end up buying a lot of food to meet the $15 minimum. This was alright thought  because leftovers (especially Chinese) are always nice.\n\nAnyhow  I ordered the chow mein lunch special with fried rice and won-ton soup  an additional order of chow mein  an order of spring rolls and and order of chicken with snow peas and mushrooms. The guy on the phone stated that it would be about 45 mins to an hour. This is a little above the average delivery time  but I figured that because they're a small  local business that it was somewhat reasonable.\n\nNeedless to say  about an hour later the delivery boy came and dropped off the food. He was nice and clean  but awkward and quiet.\n\nIt was nice to see that I was given two boxes of white rice with the order as well. I first tried the white rice and it didn't taste like traditional steamed jasmine rices do. It almost had a nutty flavor to it and it was extremely greasy for a fried rice  which was pretty odd. It didn't taste bad by any means  but it was just unusual. The wonton soup was very average. One filled wonton and strips of rare beef (?) in a light broth. Nothing special. Spring rolls were okay  pretty standard for a fast-food-ish type Asian place. The lunch special was again just alright. Fried rice was pretty much just rice with the frozen-looking peas and carrots mixed in and the chow mein was pretty greasy. It was nice to see that the chow mein did in fact have a nice portion of veggies in it  even if they looked fresh-frozen. The most disappointing part of the meal was the chicken with the snowpeas and mushrooms. It came in a bowl packed-full to the top  but when I opened up the lid  there was some sort of sauce/juice filling half the bowl and the chicken and veggies were just soaking in it. This was very disappointing and made the dish rather unappetizing. I ended up throwing about 3/4 of it away.\n\nPros:\nGood price for portion ratio\nDelivery\n\nCons:\nLong delivery wait\nSub-par quality food\nMinimum delivery charge\n\nAll in all  if you are looking for a quick/cheap place for delivery  China Jade is just ok. I would recommend nearby Red House instead. A little more pricey  but worth it for your tummy.\n\nPhotos of my food are posted.
1,My third  and final  visit to the Cornerstone.  Let me say this - the food is fine.  In fact really good.  But every occasion to eat there has been marred by poor to horrible service.  I can't decide if the staff is always overwhelmed due to short staffing  or just simply inefficient.   During brunch  a fairly busy time around noon on a Sunday  we saw our waitress once before ordering  and then not again until our food was delivered.  I had to flag down other members of the wait staff to get refills on our coffees and drinks.  Each time a refill was provided  the waitress took only one glass or mug away and brought back to the table then took the next.  If the waitress wasn't such a rarely spotted experience  this would have been OK  however this just caused more waiting for us.  Sadly  good food cannot save a restaurant that can't provide the service to support such great efforts in the kitchen.
0,Customer service was dreadful. Everyone just stood there talking to each other. At least greet your customers when they walk in/out. \n\nMess everywhere  shoes were unorganized and there wasn't a fitting room attendant. \n\nThe \"cute\" clothes were hung high from the ground. Imagine how annoying it was to hunt down an associates to grab a shirt down for you. \n\nHire new associates  ones that actually do their job and not stand around and get paid to do nothing.
2,My friend and I went into Red Square after being coerced by one of those dudes walking around saying he'd get us in free. Well I would hope so considering there was no line. I made a deal with him. He gets us in for free and give us free drink coupons. What a great deal  huh? He obliged and we went in. We ordered two drinks and realized that neither of us had any cash to tip the guy. I asked if I could tip on my card and he said no and it was ok. Very sweet guy and unfortunately I forget his name. Music was alright  nothing special.\n\nI'll have to go back to try their food one day and explore the place a little better.
3,I am surprised that this is a free show! The performance was good and the dancers really know how to dance. At the beginning they danced on the ground stage  then some ships sailing along rails along the ceiling would come out and they would be dancing in those ships. Then I understand why it's called a sky show. And the dancers threw out some necklaces like people do in Mardi Gras. It's an interesting show and you should go see it when you are in vegas!
3,Everyone needs a good thinking place. Sometimes a quiet bar is good  sometimes just your own bedroom. But there's no better thinking spot than Leith Docks. You can sit on a bench and look out to the Waters of Leith and just contemplate. I stayed here for approximately an hour and a half looking weird. But I did do a lot of thinking. Maybe too much.\n\nIf you're not a big thinker (more of a doer) then there are loads of bars and restaurants round here. I'd recommend Loch Fyne  which is a great  locally sourced seafood place set in an old boat house. In fact  I reviewed it on here if you're interested. There's also the Royal Yacht Britannia for the culture cravers (it's really worth a visit actually) and it's just a very pleasant place to be on a sunny afternoon. And remember  it's not being alone  it's being 'with yourself'. It's weird then. Is it?
3,Great desrrts..  Good service.  Food is good. Very nice decor.  The staff is very friendly.  Will go back next trip out.
3,So many places don't have red chile  but LT does and its fantastic. Although I really like this place  some of the food is way to salty for my taste. The staff is always polite (or I would never go back) and the place is very clean. Street tacos and red chile are my favs.
1,I was looking for an affordable place to stay for St. Patrick's Day weekend and came across Terrible's Hotel and Casino hoping it wouldn't be a 'terrible' place to stay. Its location is within a mile proximity of the strip  so not too shabby for someone  like me  who doesn't mind staying off the strip but not too far at the same time.\n\nAs I set foot in the door  my friend and I had our lungs overwhelmed with the heavy fumes of cigarettes you would smell in the lobby. I think they might need to look into fixing their ventilation system if they still want to keep families coming in. Then again  this is a local's casino rather than a visitor's luxurious stay. Compared to most casinos on the strip  this one is rather small with limited selections of games for you to enjoy. There are hardly people in the casinos which almost makes this place seem like a ghost town or relic of the past. \n\nThe rooms however are a different story. For someone who isn't looking for anything fancy other than a comfortable place to sleep for the night might find this place to be a hidden gem. The rooms  compared to the casino downstairs  are more modern and the beds were super comfortable. Given the strong scent of cigarettes in the casino  coming up to our room was literally a breath of fresh air  given that our floor is non-smoking. \n\nThe buffet/cafe was not bad. $10 for steak and prime rib was a great deal for what it was. I'm not expecting a USDA Prime cut there for that price  but my taste buds were happy for what it was worth  even though the prime rib came out way saltier the 2nd night than the cut on my first night's stay. \n\nOverall  I wouldn't mind staying here again if other places were booked and over-priced. The room and the cafe gets a satisfactory grade along with the price I payed for them. Terrible's  true to its name  is in dire need of remodeling and new furnace to keep this place from crumbling. If the cigarette fumes weren't so strong  I'd probably give this place another star. Most likely I will be seeking other places to room on my next visit to Las Vegas.
3,Great place to stay and gamble!!  Rooms are ok.  Big and I mean big casino!!  Be sure to check in with either Facebook or Foursquare to get special deals!  Plus  if are a Total Rewards card member  Topguest will add 50 points to your card if you check in with Facebook or Foursquare!
1,After posting my review  I received a response from the owner that included a copy of my receipt showing that he had credited me $10 for the dessert issue mentioned in my review.  He ended with this sentence  which seems to indicate that I shouldn't give his restaurant another try:  \"Thank you for your past patronage and I wish you the best in your future dining experiences elsewhere.\"  An odd response  particularly when it appears that I am not an outlier in terms of my service experience.
4,Dr Quan is definitely a life changer!  She really focuses on the whole picture of all your needs  major and minor.   She gets you in the right direction in healing and staying healed.
4,Loved this place. Service exceeded expectations  food was delivered quick and hot with just the taste and flavor I was looking for.. Thank you!
0,First let me begin by saying our salesman Steve was excellent! He was friendly  knew his stuff  and that portion was a 5 star. \n\n  The 2nd part is my 1 star rating in the department of false advertising. Posted everywhere this close to the holiday is SALE SALE SALE up to 50% off. Steve said it was an employee type of sale pricing that happens twice a year. We picked two items  put the 20% down  and just needed to proof the order online for delivery. We accidentally forgot our dimensions of measurements so we went online to check. Right online In black and white it said the couches we were buying were 1299 a piece including delivery the store's price on the specific items said 1599 a piece  and our invoice stated 1099 each  we got free delivery from the balloon pop special but the extended warranty put us above 1299 as stated online included everything. Reality is we didn't save the 3-400 per item  but in fact paying full retail!!!\n\n  I called the store to remove the extended warranty  which nobody could help me with  which in turn delayed our delivery date & only our sales rep could do this? (Really??)  You can see my order  but you can't update it  thus delaying my delivery? I asked about the online pricing versus the instore pricing and the guy (not Steve) specifically said they raise the prices on inventory 2 weeks before the sale to cosmetically make customers believe they are getting a huge savings & the website doesn't always update properly. Online is wrong  store is correct. I said to him \"let me get this right  all year it is 1299\"? Yup  \"1299 includes delivery\"? Yup  \" & 2 weeks ago all stores jack up the prices & buying them at the all year price of 1299 from 1599 is done for cosmetic reasons to lead customers to believe they are getting a huge bargain\"? Yup  as he giggled & said delivery are balloon pop items to be included at the 1299 price  so all you are really saving is the delivery charge per item and since you are getting 2 items  they deduct it off both bringing your price down to 1099.\n\n  We love the couches we picked but will be canceling our order unless they honor the 1299 price and give us the 3-400 dollar savings as stated we saved. They probably figured I would never check or a small percentage does  just as I thought this review would be helpful to others. \n\n  Happy Holidays!!
3,A pretty cool piece of weird Arizona history. It's just a mile of two off the highway so if you are interested in history it's worth a stop if you are on your way to Vegas.
4,Got a bowl to-go and it was great. I wish I would have got some sauce. I will be back to try more for sure. Keep up the good quality and nice pieces of chicken.
1,I used to love coming to this restaurant when I was younger.  I haven't been back in a few years so I thought it was time to go back.  I'm not so sure that I'll be back after this visit.\n\nFirst off  the ban chan or appetizers came after our bul go gi was brought out.  The waitress just threw our bul go gi on the table. When I asked her about the sides she just walked away.  The hostess was very sweet and apologized for the missing appetizers.  \n\nThe bul go gi and chicken bul go gi was as good as I remembered but when it came time for the bill  I found that they had already added a 20% tip for just 2 people!  That's ridiculous.  They weren't that great to be including the tip into my bill for me.  \n\nSad to say but I'm not sure if I'll go back.  Just head up to Sura where it's all you can eat.
0,If I could give 0 stars I would. WORST AIRLINE EVER! I booked off Expedia and there was no mention that when I got to the airport I would be PAYING 50$ for a carry on!! Unbelievable! I totally understand the fee for a checked bag but a small carry on? Unreal. The horrible staff said I would still be paying less than a flight on another airline. WRONG. Had I booked the other flight on virgin that was almost booked I would pay 5$ more when booking on Expedia however wouldn't have to spend the 50$ EACH way for my carry on. Now to the problems while AT the airport. I'm flying an hour flight And I'm delayed over 2 hours. Not for weather or something uncontrollable. For \"aircraft maintenance\". Which means the AIRLINE wasn't prepared. And what do they do to compensate? Absolutely NOTHING. I will NEVER FLY THIS AIRLINE AGAIN! And unless they refund my flight or bags or something! I will make sure everyone I know  including my 3 000 fb friends  family  etc know how horrible of an airline this is. I will be surprised if you are still in business within the year. I fly way to often to deal with this over priced  rude  and trashy airline!! \nGood like spirit
3,I had the Bun Bo Hue (pronounced \"boon-bo-hway). If you've never heard of it  it's a spicy (obviously from the picture) beef based soup that a lot of places serve on the weekend. The broth's balance of salty  sour  sweet and savoury balances on a fine line where a little bit in either direction will throw the soup off completely. There is a profound depth of flavour in this noodles dish  fragrant in lemongrass and spices  the toppings are similar to the dac biet  with the addition of black pepper \"cha lua\" - Vietnamese steamed pork loaf  the same that's found in banh mi  however  the rice noodles in this dish are thicker and cylindrical.
2,You know  I want to give this place a better rating. I really do. The service was excellent  the ambiance was nice  and my friends and I walked in looking like our disheveled selves after a long day and we were still sat quickly and treated with respect. I'll give the service five stars  easy. From top to bottom  the staff was fantastic.\n\nThe food... the food was fine. It wasn't five star food  but they're no slouches in the kitchen either. I tasted a few dishes and ended up getting the cappriciosa pizza; artichokes  prosciutto  mushrooms  olives. In theory  it sounded great.\n\nThe pizza was razor thin and a little bit soggy. The dough just couldn't support all the toppings! It was a tasty combination  but it needed to be bound together just a *weeeeee* bit more. I enjoyed the meal  but it could have been a lot better for me.\n\nI'll probably come back and try something else  but it's not at the top of my list of places to go again.
4,So far  I've went here to pick up their two sliced pizza lunch special. As much as I would like to review this place a bit more thoroughly (customer service  dine-in experience  facilities  etc). My overly satisfied taste buds wanted to go ahead and rate them now!\n\nTheir pizza is really  really good. I'm a die hard pizza lover  and I have had my fair share of assorted pizzas  from frozen to fast food chains  to actual gourmet pizzas at restaurants.\n\nAll I can say is  Oregano's pizza is on a class of it's own. And for me  that's very important with pizza; to have their own distinct flavor. It's so good in fact  that even if someone gave me pizza in an unmarked box  I would be able to tell it's Oregano's.\n\nNow  I am no food critic. But their pizza makes me want to be one; Just for the moment at least.\n\nTheir bread and crust is nice  thin  crunchy  and flaky at just the right level. You can also taste the creaminess of the mozzarella cheese  with the impact of that deli-licious pepperoni slices. And the best part is  the marinara sauce isn't drenched and is \" volume\"d out perfectly.\n\nIf it comes to the pizza I have no complaints. I would really look forward to getting a chance to dine-in and try their pastas.\n\nKudos Oregano's
1,So I finally tried Rocco's...I probably won't be back to try a few of their items. It is a nice place and customer service was friendly but from what I had and what everyone else in my group had it was more misses than hits. \n\nI had the chicken and broccoli fettuccine alfredo. My picture isn't a true representation  it was worst. The noodles were very under cooked. Under cooked pasta noodles are good if they were freshly made but when they're out the box or bag cook it longer. It was partially transparent in the middle  crunchy and gummy in other parts. It was like eating those Asian microwavable chow mein dishes but for pasta. It took me forever to finish it not because of it size but because it was just bad  even tried letting it maybe cook in its sauce but it never happened. I didn't care for the chicken pieces and sauce it was more like they cutted up half of a 6 piece chicken McNuggets box and added a bad bottled or canned alfredo sauce. The only positive thing about the dish was the broccoli seemed fresh  bright green and had a nice crisp when bitten into. \n\nA few in the group ordered some calzones. Right out of the oven and before they started eating it I was thinking that they're a nice smaller than usual calzones that I'd be back for.  However after noticing that 2 of the calzones weren't finished it seemed like maybe it's not that good. It seemed like the cheese was mostly left in the plates  it didn't look so tasty.\n\nTheir strombolis and pizzas did look really good these were ordered and left without a trace on the plates of those who ordered them. Maybe I'll be back for these.  They have a 2 cheese pizza slices and a drink special for about $5. Their Fra Diavolo also looked good from across the table  it had pasta  mussels  and a red sauce. I liked that they displayed the actually pizza   strombolis  and calzones on the counter because they just look so good. They have these signs on the walls saying in big letters that they have best of various things and deals they have  it makes you want to get them and prove em wrong or right.  \n\nI'll probably be back but not anytime soon so expect an update unless I get the same experience that time also.
2,My only big complaint was the screen was dirty and old looking. It was distracting. Time for a new screen.
4,Free entry and free drinks.\n\nMy friend and I wanted to go to the Palms Masquerade party and signing up online through the palms site seemed iffy. I got a response 3 days before the event and that was just too late especially if you've spent time and effort in getting costumes together. One girl told me that they sometimes let people know 1 day in advance. Why so late?\n\nWell  Chris got back to us the next day- he put us on the guestlist and that was that.  We also signed up for some other clubs online. Since we forgot to write down which ones  Chris did text us back the day of to remind us. \n\nWith the masquerade thing  it got too crazy so Chris organized it so that we got hard tickets (pick up the same day). I think it's reduced entry for guys but tickets were about $150?!\n\nFor each of the clubs  Bank  Marquee  Jet  XS  and of course  all the ones at Palms  we only needed to mention Chris' name for quick and hassle free entry. Most of those clubs provided free drinks for ladies until midnight so that was a perk. \n\nI'm not sure about the other clubs but while we were at the Mirage pool  my friend was approached by a promoter who put us on the guestlist for Pure and while we were at Wynn (enroute to the buffet)  we were put on the guestlist for Blush. \n\nDefinitely contact Chris if you want to party instead of waiting in lines.
3,I have to say that I wasn't excited about going.  I'm not a fan of big places like Outback  Claim Jumpers  and the like.  But I was so not prepared for this menu.  I had Halibut Cheeks...and they were SO delicious.  Our waiter  Jacob  helped it to be an enjoyable evening sitting outside on this beautiful autumn evening.  His brew suggestions were spot on as were his menu tips.  There was not one person at the table who went away with a full  satisified tummy and a big grin on their faces.  My husband had a delicious bourbon soaked salmon with sweet potatoe ravioli.  I can't wait to go back and I have a feeling 5 stars are in its future.
3,We have to get crepes from La Creperie every time we're in Vegas. Ahhh  how delicious they are. It seems the price goes up annually  but 1 crepe is enough for a meal. The most difficult thing is to choose what kind to have. The savory crepes are just as delicious as the sweet ones. This is a fairly inexpensive way to eat in Vegas  and since it's a casual seat-yourself setting  good for kids and a quick meal without having to pay tips or wait to be served. Did I mention these crepes are absurdly delicious?! My favorite - the Napoleon; lemon custard with berries. Now I'm hungry...
3,I'm not sure when this place opened  but I cannot believe it took me this long to get here!\n\nThey have a TON of vegan options and several gluten-free options which make them hella-rad in my book! \n\nThis is a pay-at-the-counter-and-eat-off-of-paper-plates type of place  which is fine by me because it keeps the costs down and the portions large!\n\nI had the gobi manchurian (SO AMAZING) and the spiced rice. My dining partner had one of the platters and she was loving every bit of it.\n\nI will be back... watch out!
0,I used to go there was good food and the price was reasonable but now the food is sort of fairy and the price is skyrocket. Not worth going there.
1,Had dinner here with the family the other night...probably will be our only visit to this restaurant. The neutrals to negatives outweigh the positives.\nWe started off with an order of the Skillet Nachos. These were pretty good - no complaints. The toppings weren't overdone as you may get with other restaurants nachos that drown the chips creating a mushy mess.\nFor an entr\u00e9e I had the Cubano torta. This was good and had a nice flavored mustard. The rest of the family ordered a variety of tacos. This is where things started to go downhill. Rather than have each person's tacos on individual plates they were brought out on one big plate  family style and everyone had to guess and sort out which was what. The feedback I got on the tacos was they were OK...nothing spectacular. We also ordered the strEAT corn to share which did have a nice flavor. However  all the food came out warm  at best. One positive of the food is the portion sizes were just right. \nThe service was pleasant enough and the d\u00e9cor was very nice  but those things alone will not warrant another visit. Also  what is with the Tommy Hilfiger style logo?
2,Tried this LA transplant at the new Palazzo and I'll admit the food is pretty good. Although I've never tried the LA version  but we had a plethora of different foods ranging from the cheese and bread to the lobster and steak.\n\nThe decor was nothing to wow you  which is odd considering how new of a place it is and it being in Vegas  but from a French steakhouse it was contempoary yet understated  if that makes any sense. Also I'd note that the service was impeccable  but then again I was with a high roller.
2,Not all 24 Hour Fitness locations are created equal.  Although the Wigwam location is a lot bigger and fancier  the front desk people seemed damn near mentally retarded.  One of them didn't know how to scan my ID card to save his life.  That's why I'm sticking to my location at Silverado/Maryland Parkway.\n\nThis location is pretty good too.  I've been to quite a few 24 Hours and they all seem to have their own personality/clientele.  This one seems to attract a lot of stripper/ultimate fighter types  of which I'm neither.  Nevertheless  this place has a large selection of cardio equipment/weight machines and free weights.  There's also a large room for kickboxing/yoga classes  not to mention a huge basketball court.  If they mix in a juice bar  like the Balboa location in San Diego  the rating would go up.  The 24 Hour Fitness locations here also need to start up the finger scan entry  rather than having to show my ID card every time.
1,Several years ago we dined a few times at this restaurant and were not impressed  but I had points to burn and the current menu indicated 21-day  dry aged beef is now being served so we (actually I) decided to give it one more try - silly me.  \n\nEntrees include a choice of potato and salad with my wife choosing garlic mashed that were puree like and garlic-lite.  My baker with sour cream was better.  The salads were primarily iceberg lettuce that had been topped with diced tomatoes  a couple of olives and red onion tossed in for good measure and dressed with bottled blue cheese.  \n\nThough our slabs of cow were served medium rare as requested  it took a Herculean effort to just to cut them into bite sized pieces.  Our server seemed to be on auto pilot and never once stopped by to inquire if we need anything or had concerns.  This was proved to be by far the most disappointing meal of our entire 14 day vacation.
1,Used to love this place with the good food and amazing views but the service truly sucks now. We waited nearly 30 minutes before I finally flagged a waitress down to find out who our server was - she simply sneered and said \"well it's not me honey!\" That was enough for us to leave and never return. Too bad  I kind of miss the place.
4,This place is amazing! The atmosphere is great  so unique  we thoroughly enjoyed everything! The sake fizz cocktails were delicious and you must try one. The staff was so polite and knowledgeable and very accommodating.\nWe tried a little of everything  and the flavors and presentation scored a 10!
3,Exactly what the name is. Servers and bartenders are knowledge of all beers. They have wine for those of you who don't care for beer and rumor is in a few weeks they will have liquor. Ask for Jess as a server.
4,Thank you  Shine!\n \nI cannot say enough good things about this place.\n \nTheir concept was simple  great blow outs and superb customer service.  Finally!\n \nI had been to several blow dry bars in the area. However  the service at these other establishments was horrible or the blowout didn't last 24 hours.I finally found the perfect spa-like setting without the corporate feel. \n \nLiz was amazing and offered a long lasting blowout. \n\nMy hair looked great days after the blowout.  It was well worth the money.
4,We popped in here after a long day walking around the city and were just ready for any food put in front of us. What we got was so much more than what we expected. The waitress was friendly  attentive  and incredibly helpful with the all-French menu. She read and described everything on the menu for us and helped us make some great selections. We started with gravlax (sp?)  my girlfriend had lamb  I had boar  and we finished with a creme brul\u00e9. All the food was incredible and the creme brul\u00e9 was easily the best we've ever had. If you're in Montreal and you want French food  you HAVE to come here. The prices definitely reflect the quality of the food and service.
0,Got the Honey Bacon Club and tomato basil soup. Not worth the nearly $9 for the pick 2. If you're in the Norterra area  save your self and go to Paradise instead. We won't be going back.
2,I'm not really too thrilled about this place  but it is conveniently located near the places I work at around Scotsdale.  The thing is  they are consistenly mediocre  and that kinda works to their advantage.  I wish I could give them more stars  its just their food isn't really that good  but it's not bad either.  It's good if you feel like this type of chinese when you're in Scottsdale and you don't feel like spending a fortune.  Joyful house on Hayden is just a little better.
2,Food is good  cookies are great. Buy one cookie and get one free. Bargain. I love the half sandwich and soup. The chicken posole is delicious and a favorite of mine. A great plus is there is free wireless internet service.
1,It's sad. I've been a loyal customer of Rito's Burritos since the Original on Garfield st. Since then I've been excited when they opened a location closer to me  the Orangewood location. When I tried that location it was like I was eating the same quality as the original. \n\nNow when this location opened  just a little closer to me  I was excited  thinking I'd get fat from visiting too much. That worry was soon solved as I took my first bite into their burros. It's missing a lot. First off  the chile is really thick  although this wouldn't be too bad a thing it's too obvious. It's clearly thickened with flour  because my mouth still feels gritty from eating it. There was so much flour that it was half the flavor of the burro. Second  if that wasn't enough flour for you. The burro is wrapped in a very thick tortilla  unlike their other locations which have a great balance of chile (and thickness)  as well as the thickness of their tortillas.\n\nI had high hopes for you guys but you let me down. To those who read this  don't be discouraged about Rito's. Their original and Orangewood locations still deliver the goods.
4,I drive 30 mins for this place because they are the best. They have done work pants to bridesmaids dresses for me
1,Sad update. We returned to Kiku Sushi the next day for lunch. They had tons and I mean  a lot of food revolving around  but there were no customers to eat it. The egg rolls and gayoza were stone cold  but there is a sign stating they will heat it up. They took the deep fried combo and dropped it in the fryer again. Kind of grossed me out. Who knows how long any of that food had been on that revolving belt. The cucumber salad was kind of wilted and had to be at least an hour old. \n\nIt seems that they need a better system when demand is slow. Also  there is one server that just stands and stares at us pretty much the entire time we are eating. It is very uncomfortable. I overlooked it the first time because I thought she might just be tired or something  but she had the same dumb expression this time for an hour and just watched us while wiping lids. The server disappeared for very long periods of time  I'm talking 10 minutes with no sightings. This was the same server from the night before. The few times she came out  she had her cellphone in hand. The rest of the staff was nice  and the chef came over and explained some speciality rolls to us then offered to make some fresh for us to taste. That was yummy and served at an appropriate temp.\n\nI really hope the owner or mgmt. figures out a system to keep old food off the belt. I cannot return until they do. I just think that it should be an obvious issue  and if it isn't  what are they serving me the rest of the time. The standards must be raised before I return. My love affair with Kiku Sushi is on hold until they up their standards.
1,I think what this Vons has it going for them is their proximity to UNLV. I wasn't around before the remodel  so I can only base my review on what it currently looks like.\n\nPrices are standard for a grocery  though I've found that their organic items tends to be a tad more pricey than other normal groceries. This Vons has a \"darker\" feel to it  though I think they were going for a natural-light feel.\n\nAs mentioned  this Vons location is very close to UNLV. I see students going here often. I usually go after class to pick up some groceries or whatnot. A few times I had went while carrying my backpack. I got some hassle today from an employee there about my backpack. It's just a small backpack  and I wasn't carrying a purse. :\\\n\nI noticed today that they had new products in their small gluten free section. I love that they have been rotating their stock  but I noticed that they don't have any Bakery on Main items anymore! That was one of the reasons I went to this Vons location (besides it being near UNLV). They had in the past always carried Bakery on Main's cranberry granola. Now I have to make a trek over to Sunflower or some other market.
0,What is it with these Leslie Pool guys?  It doesn't matter which one I go to  they're all nasty and crabby.  They act like I'm a nuisance going in there to ask questions abiut  get this  my pool!  Or they treat me like I'm some kind of idiot and not worth their time.  Guess I'll just stick to B&B pools over at McClintock and baseline. They are the absolute best.
2,Food was ok.  Maybe average to slightly above average depending on the item.  But the price seemed a little steep.  It could be that I'm still not totally used to the higher price of food in Montreal compared to the US  but still  it seemed a little too much for the quality.  I went there because someone else picked the restaurant  but I'd probably try to avoid this place in the future.
3,We grabbed up a Groupon for this museum which was for the Adult's Night Out Da Vinci exhibit viewing.  We loved it!  \n\nI'm a touch confused by some of the other reviewers on here that went and complained about parking and screaming children. First  park in the Science Center parking garage and they validate (so it's free).  Second  it's a museum...kids go there so it's a tad unrealistic to expect them to not be there unless you are going to Adult's Night Out - which is why we purchased the ticket we purchased.  We don't have kids just yet  and wanted a date night.  Bam!  Adult's Night Out to the rescue!  \n\nThe Da Vinci exhibit is closed now  however it was very well organized and set up.  The catered food was delicious and well presented.  The staff was helpful in guiding us when we needed it.  \n\nAll in all  a great night out!  Grab a Groupon and make it a date night.  ;)
4,Bustling and lively\nGreat tasting Guinness\nMONTE CRISTO SANDWICH.\n\nThis was my first time ever trying a fabled Monte Cristo sandwich. I opted out  of the raspberry dipping sauce which  according to both the waitress and my friend  was a mistake on my part. Such a delicious treat! Paired with a tasty Guinness  my tummy was in heaven!
0,I love what Project Lodge is attempting to accomplish in the Madison area.  However  their less than admirable professionalism causes them to miss out on many great events  not to mention mismanage events like being burglarized.  My friend's piece of silver artwork was stolen from this venue (along with another artist's work) and they were very shady about the entire ordeal.\n\n*Because the Project Lodge recently reached out to me  I thought it fair to add to my original review that the \"Pro Lo\" has as of 2011 obtained new management.  Furthermore  nothing of the sort has surfaced since new management has taken over.
4,Awesome to do business with  really recommend for all auto needs..shawn and the crew great job well done on my tundra.will be going back there to do oil change rather than dealership..thanks again!!
1,Instead of gagging on CPK fare  I gagged on Ruby's egg muffin instead. At the height of the breakfast hour  I was served a rubbery egg sandwich with coagulated cheese and cold bacon. How dare they charge almost $7 for that crap!
3,This place is the jam. I was pleasantly surprised from the moment I pulled into the parking lot. The Steak taco with the tempura style poblano was one of the best tacos I've ever had. The guac was legit too. I think this is one of the few guac servings that we weren't able to finish being it was such a heaping pile of goodness. And the frozen margaritas are the way to go  tastes just like the famous Z-tejas margs.
2,If you have stay on the strip cheap  I suppose this is the place to do it.  It's so dingy  run down that it was ruining the Vegas experience for me.  However  once you get to the room you'll find it spartan but clean and adequate  strangely better maintained than the rest of the hotel itself.  That's why they get 3 stars instead of 2.  \n\nps.  I appreciated the laminated notice sheet telling me calls were not free and I could get a free needle disposal box on request.  lol
0,We flew US Air weekly for months.  My fianc\u00e9 purchased First class for a flight and the seat pocket was overflowing with trash and there were crushed chips all over the floor.  The response from US Air was that they would look into it.  The money had been spent so it really was not much of a remedy for us.\n\nI flew my 4 lb. dog on every flight.  On February 1  2013 a member from the check in crew pulled my carry on bag.  Told me I could not have one because I had a pet.  My pet was in a carrier the size of a purse and I paid $125 for the privilege.  I had nothing other than her and one carry on bag that met the overhead size requirements.  I had laptop  glasses  etc. in the bag and it was rudely taken from me.  The person in the seat next to me on the plane told me that she was behind me when I boarded and witnessed a crew that was unsure whether they were right or wrong in grabbing my bag but decided to do it anyway.  I will remember this day clearly because this happened hours before my fiance proposed.  My point in sharing this is that flying is a necessary evil to get from A to B.  We have good and bad in our lives that require us to travel.  All that most of us expect is to be treated simply as a customer.  What I see more of is this kind of gotcha mentality at the gate.  They want to collect more money to check in baggage. There is zero customer service with this carrier and I felt defeated for all the weekly travel that I had placed with them.  Go Southwest instead.
2,To be succinct:\n\n$2.50 for my iced Americano - just like the menu said it would be. Of course  I had to ask where the menu was - amusing. My Americano was spot-on. I barely had to add any milk or sugar.\n\nSuch a small space with hardly any parking whatsoever. Inside  very little options when sitting. No  I don't want to sit on a wooden chair for over 2 hours  thanks. Wish this place had more plush seats. \n\nDecor is cool and relaxing. Really liked the layout and I found the bathroom to be even cool. Go fig. Service was prompt and friendly. \n\nI'd go back  yes. But only to grab and run - maybe even do the drive-thru thing. Doubt I could find an open seat inside (or a parking spot outside)  so why bother?
3,Love it.\n\n24-hour cafe  but it tastes WAY better than just a cafe.  The interior feels spacious with their high ceiling  and the food is really tasty.  I know there are so many \"fine\" restaurants in and around the Palazzo.\n\nBut this place is priced reasonably  and will satisfy your appetite.  You can spend $18 for a bowl of Pho (at the Asian restaurant in the Palazzo)  but why the hell would you?\n\nCome here with an appetite  and I am sure that you will go away feeling good and ready to hit the tables again!
4,Love this store! I always stop by when I'm in Las Vegas... I only wish they had them in other parts of the country... Oh well  I guess I HAVE TO GO to Vegas again....lol Fran
2,I'm not much of a burger person  so take my review with a grain of salt. My friend really hyped Burger Bar up for me  so I was expecting something amazing. In the end  I realized I prefer In 'n' Out.\n\nI just got bleu cheese  avocado  and bacon on my burger  and the bacon was crispy and spectacular. As a whole though  it was just okay. Considering we spent more than $50 for two burgers  two orders of fries  and one soda  I was unimpressed.\n\nI've also tried Burger Brasserie and Gordon Ramsay BURGR  and I found them to both be delicious  unique  and worth the outrageous cost. But Burger Bar just didn't do it for me. I'll give it another shot if someone insists but will never choose this place on my own.
0,A security guard here told me that I needed to leave because I had dozed off for a moment after drinking. While I realize that Las Vegas establishments  hotels  bars and especially clubs don't want people sleeping in the public areas--I certainly don't have control over how alcohol affects my body. I had two drinks  I was tired and I was waiting for my ride to leave anyway. I wasn't a nuisance and I clearly wasn't belligerent or obnoxiously drunk.\n\nI asked the security guard that I wanted to say goodbye to my party of two friends  which he let me did. But then he had the gall to say as I was leaving \"that he didn't have to let me say goodbye.\"\n\nFrankly  this guard was rude. The Mirage hotel is never getting my business ever again.
2,Went here after reading the Vegas magazine in my hotel room. Was listed in the dining section for the hotels on the strip. And knowing Kerry Simon from his battle on Iron Chef America  off we went to give it a try.\n\nFirst off  the decor was pretty cool with \"1960's Russian propaganda posters and thematic fixtures\". Very modern and hip feel. Our server was cool and fast. A few women servers were dressed in sexy military attire (wish one of them served us). haha.\n\nOn to the food. There's a nice selection of house special burgers and a \"build your own\" section. I went and ordered a house item the Cobb Burger. Has bacon  blue cheese  avocado  tomato salsa  red pepper mayo and a sesame brioche bun.\n\nOnce i got it....i was like...hmm. The burger was put together kinda sloppy and i wasn't diggin' the basket presentation. I cut the burger in half to see the layers of all the \"goodness\". Still wasn't looking \"wow\". My medium ordered cooked meat looked more like less than medium-rare. So after the visuals i decided to go ahead and take a bite...\n\nOh... this is pretty good. I wish it was cooked to medium  but  i got the flavor of the bacon and blue cheese and the mayo. the areas where the meat was cooked to my liking was tasty and flavorful. I liked the chopped bacon which is a change from other burgers that have slices. The bun was good  but for some reason it was really filling  And the fries were just ok.\n\nOverall  it was good  It wasn't \"wow\" and a few disappointments. But I'd give this place a try again. Maybe pair a vodka with a burger. hmmm?\n\nI know people complain of prices  but heck. it's Vegas and it's a famous chef's restaurant. Live it up. ;)\n\nThanks!
1,ATTENTION DIFFERENT LOCATIONS CHARGE DIFFERENT PRICES AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FOR THE SAME ITEMS ! i saw this when I wanted to exchange 4 items at the Scottsdale Rd store. I was told prices are based on zip codes. The amazing part the higher prices are areas see as lower income areas on items of need not luxury .
0,So I went for my anniversary. Movie started at 810 we wasnt able to go in til 810 (I arrived at 730) movies comin out soon was already rolling.so  we sit.  The couple behind us was coughing and  sneezing so I asked to sit somewhere else(which I was able to) so now im at the very top row. I order chicken nachos with just chicken and cheese   coconut chicken and peperoni pizza. My drinks come out and then my nachos with everything on it(peppers  tomato  cheese n chicken) im allergic to tomatoes so I switch it to chips n salsa which is very tomatoe so im just eating chips then my pizza come out but with coconut shrimp which Im allergic to the point I cant even smell it...once I realized what it is now im itching and coughing so I tell the server(cuz he at the couple next 2 me) then he takes it pass me..so I go and finds a manager amd hes like o im sorry ill have a talk with my staff.. horrible so now on my anniversary im broke out like a blowfish n the face and itcy. .it will b awhile b4 I go back
4,Came in for lunch since I heard such great things about this place. Sat at the bar so I wouldn't have to wait for a table. Nice atmosphere and around 11:30am the business suits started rolling in from the surrounding buildings. Great service at the bar. He suggested the chicken quinoa salad  which had more lettuce and less chicken and quinoa.  Nice healthy portion and was just enough for lunch. Will be back for dinner sometime soon!
1,Only stopped here for a quick check to see if they had tiramisu - they DID!  Score!  But overall  it's not worth saying much more about.  The cafe au lait was below average  the wait staff seemed (as others have said) bitchy)  and they served the tiramisu in a square plastic container.  If the tiramisu had been good  I could have given it more stars  but not in Vegas.\n\nI also saw the infamous owner running around; he wasn't yelling at anyone that I could see  but he looked intense!
2,Decent food for a decent price. I tried the fish tacos and the honey croissants. Pretty good. Service was friendly.
1,Still serving cold burgers. \n\nThe chili is good though. \n\nThe cherry Dr Pepper hits the spot too.
0,I normally dont like to write a bad review but this place warrants it.  The food was terrible!! The service was even worst!!!  We were seated immediatly cause we were the only ones there and it went down hill from there.  It took bout 10 minutes for them to come back with water and another 10 minutes before they even took the order.  I ordered pho of course and some of my friends did as well. 20 minutes later they come out with the food and of course one of the server spills my bowl over a friend of mine. I was willing to look past all this if the food was great...it wasnt to say the least.  Worst tasting pho i've ever eaten  it was even hot. The vietnamese food in vegas is horrible compared to LA and this place is by far the worst of them all.  Just to add the final nail in the coffin here but this place is much more expensive then other pho places are around.  My bill was over 100 bucks for 8 people which is expensive for pho.
1,I'm with Chad W. below. I dropped off a chain saw and the conversation on the phone was very positive. However  he never called me back or gave me a diagnosis and it's not that hard to make a one minute call. He had the saw for weeks. Finally  I just went and picked up my broken chain saw and then he gave me an estimate. But by then it was too late. I'm sure he could fix the chain saw and his rates were reasonable but since this is apparently a side business  he just doesn't have the time to repair promptly. Too bad  because he is a very nice man.
4,I've been going here for four years for school-related projects  but today I went with my aunt for one last trip before I leave Pittsburgh for good. I was happy to see several Chihuly pieces still on display (by far my favorite exhibit that they've ever done). Their current exhibition involves Gargoyles  and the mythical stone creatures either provided a nice contrast to the sweet flowers  or they blended well into the lush scenery. It was a nice homage to some of the gothic architecture in Pittsburgh.\n\nAlso  if you're in town soon  check out the agave plant in the cactus room. After taking a range of 10 to 70 years to grow  it's center has shot through the roof of the building -- a sign that it's now near the end of its life. \nI would definitely recommend visiting Phipps if you're touring Pittsburgh. Museums are a dime a dozen  but this conservatory is something different. It's a perfect visit no matter the weather (and weather has a tendency to go wrong in Pittsburgh) and even the children's garden was captivating to me (I seriously spent twenty minutes walking around with a plastic elephant shaped watering can  looking for something to water).
4,This is absolutely the best strip club for locals to go. Happy Hour is from 4pm-7:30pm every day except for Tuesday. All the other days  Monday  Wednesday  Thursday  Friday  Saturday  and Sunday  Budweiser  Bud Light  and Vodka drinks are free. No Cover Charge on those days.\n\nThe staff is quite friendly from the door greeters  to the lovely bartenders  the dancers  the DJ's  and the Security. There's a light skinned Black lady that's in charge there. She's very cute as well  and she walks by with a nice smile making sure you're having a good time either as a local or a tourist.\n\nI like this place personally because I can drink  watch sports on their many HD tv's  and they even order big boxing fights and UFC pay-per-views. Their bathrooms are always clean and have working hot water. Their dancers are friendly  top notch looks wise  dance well on stage or in person  and they actually hold conversations with you while you're enjoying your drinks. \n\nThis is the best place for your money if you're a local or whether you're a tourist. Your dollar goes further here  and you get service with a smile. Easily the best strip club available in all of Clark County. I would recommend this place again and again.
2,Street tacos are not good but salsa and chips are awesome as well as taco salad! Atmosphere is ok and manager was willing to give a replacement meal for the nasty street tacos!
2,Trendy restaurant not far from the midst of things.  We ended up here after the line for the buffet was way too long and we had tickets for \"O\".  They had some pretty decent drinks and the food was artistically presented.  There were a few food items that we were not so impressed with  but I do recall the mango chutney with the poki was lovely! \n\nWe were only able to grab these seats on a Saturday night because we weren't officially at a real table  but rather in the bar area.  It worked for us.  We were able to order from the main menu still without the wait.  \n\nOverall  it was decent...nothing particularly fabulous nor horrendous for me either.  It worked for us.\n\n(You can check out my photos above!)
3,Caffe e Cucina opened not too long ago (and conveniently just across the road from our flat) in what used to be Loopy Lorna's  and is a better place by far to my mind! Tasty food  a welcoming atmosphere  and conveniently late hours make for an enthusiastic thumbs-up.\n\nWe've visited twice now- once for breakfast  once for lunch  and loved it both times. The decor makes for a warm atmosphere  helped by the friendly staff  and the food doesn't disappoint. The veggie Eggs Benedict (with spinach) is a well made and tasty alternative to the usual Scottish brekkie- though they have that too. The cherry tomato and rocket linguine made for a hearty lunch - if a little heavy on the oil for my taste. My girlfriend had the pan-fried sea-bass  and tells me it was great  and perfectly cooked. \n\nHighly recommended  and a great place for lunch if you're in Morningside- especially if you're visiting Henri's French deli across the road.
4,UNLV  what can I say?  Rebel through and through!  Rebels baby  all about Rebels.
4,Food was great and the blood orange martinis are soooo good. We went on a Sunday night and only had to wait like 20 min. And there were 4 of us. We took our kids with us and they enjoyed the wings and a burger.
4,Amazing performers...top notch. These swimmers knew exactly what they were doing  and boy  did they know how to put on a show. Can't wait to see them again.
0,Run  don't walk away from this place.  I'm a slut for a good bowl of soup.  I literally go to sleep at night dreaming about package ramen noodle. After dining in this restaurant today I died a little bit inside.\n\nAll I can say about the soup is it smelled awful  had zero flavor  fuck  I'm actually angry I wasted a meal in Vegas at this kennel.\n\nDined with a total of 8 people. Our food came out in 3 shifts last plate coming out 15 minutes after the first.  Honestly I don't even want to keep writing about it.  Do not eat here.
4,The best traditional Irish pub in the valley just got a whole lot better!  With a great new menu and fantastic happy hour deals  Fibber Magee's has become our new favorite place to enjoy food and cocktails.   We especially enjoy the half price flat breads and appetizers from 4 to 7 p.m.  my favorites being the lamb skewers and the short rib sliders.  The happy hour drink specials are also a great deal with my favorite beer  an ice cold Stella Artois  priced at only $2.25 for a 17 ounce pint.  \n\nFibber's has a very warm and comfortable atmosphere  with eye-pleasing wooden tables  chairs  floors  bookcases  etc.  The bar has very good background music  and the live bands that regularly appear are always entertaining.  Fibber Magee's also has some of the coolest bartenders and wait staff we have ever met.  Clayton  Will  Mark  and Mike all have a way of making us feel right at home every time we visit.
1,Went for lunch on Dec. 28.  Arrived at 11:30 and had to wait 90 minutes.  Service was  good but I was really disappointed in the food since I had read many reviews raving about the pizza.  It was ok but not great.  And when you have to wait that long (I understand our wait was not out of the ordinary) the food should be fabulous.  We often go to Serious Pie in Seattle and like their pizza much better ---and  never have to wait 90 minutes!!
3,Takara has become a regular in our rotation.  The fish is just so fresh.  Whatever I thought of the soy sauce in my earlier review simply isn't an issue anymore.  The food is just really good.  \n\nThe atmosphere isn't as hip and sophisticated as Murimoto - but the fish is as good  or better and really nicely garnished.  Seaweed salad is really nice.  \n\nService still isn't stellar - but I'll concede that in exchange for the quality of the food.
3,Not a HUGE fan of TGI Friday's (I prefer indies to chains)  but they do have all day happy hour  which is pretty solid.  Alvin L summed it up pretty well in his review.  Also  the Jack Daniels steaks are pretty tasty.
4,Sauce is great. The pizza are perfect for lunch. They come in one size with a few topping combinations ranging from traditional (pepperoni/mushroom) to original (proscuetto/melon). They offer solid salads and paninis  but missing out on the pizza is a mistake.\n\nPrices range from $8-12. Seating is sometimes tight.
4,Recently in Vegas for a conference by myself.  Didn't really want to spend alot to go out to eat  or go eat at fancy places by myself.  I was so grateful I found this gem in the Wynn  where the sandwiches were reasonably priced (for Vegas) and I could get them to go.  Did not have to wait long at all for my orders.\n\nHad a reuben  which was amazing.  Very soft rye (I believe they make all their breads in house) and it was lightly grilled.  Perfect combo of corned beef  kraut  swiss  and 1000 island.  The best part was that it was NOT greasy at all.\n\nAlso tried the chicken club  which again was served on fantastic bread and was not greasy.  \n\nCan't wait to go back to this place!
0,The store is darling but the grooming services are AWFUL!  I went to Susan for years and tolerated the 12 hour grooming sessions.  I'd take my boys in to have them done and LITERALLY 12 hours later she would tell me they were done.  This happened on MANY occasions.  I know Susan has some health struggles (standing long hours on her feet for years) but seriously enough is enough.  The last time I took them in she not only didn't have them ready after more than 12 hours in the shop-yes I was told I could come get them at 9 pm on a Friday night when I took them in at 8 am- but they were barely touched.  I paid for her services and I have never been back.  She needs to hang up her scissors or take fewer animals because that was a terrible way to treat a longtime loyal customer.  \n\nI was furious and felt VERY mistreated and had every right to feel that way.
2,Every time I've come here it has been a good experience except once. Normally everything is great. The environment is great and the service is exceptional. The breadsticks are to die for and the free salad is delicious. I've liked every dish I've ever had there. The price is competitive if not lower than other Italian food restaurants in the valley. The last time I was here I did have my first bad experience though. Unfortunately we happened to sit at a long table facing the front of the restaurant.  During our meal an infestation of cockroaches started coming out of the wall along the cracks of the booth. Needless to say this freaked out my grandmother and about gave her a heart attack. Olive Garden gave us a give card and did a good job trying to make up for everything that happened. I assume this is a very rare and unfortunate situation.
4,What a gift to have around the corner!\n\nI agree with one of the previous reviewers....from the outside it doesnt look like anything special.  But the inside is wonderfully appointed with tasteful furnishing and artwork.  Tranquil and peaceful.  The bar too is unassuming yet refined and classy.\n\nThe waitstaff is all wonderful.  You'll feel like you've been transported to another state of mind where customer service is once again important.  The guys are great!  Such professional courtesy.  \n\nThe menu is great.  They have pictures for people so that they know what they are ordering  yet the staff is eager to offer suggestions.  Everything is a speciality.  They have 7 or 8 different types of specialty rices.  The lamb shank is incredible as are all the kabobs and the kebodah!  \n\nNo matter what you order  they bring out the softest  fresh hot pita with butter and raw onions.  May sound like a strange combo  but you won't feel that way after trying it.  \n\nAnd no matter how awesome your meal is (and I promise you will be shocked at how great it tastes) I challenge you to find a way to finish it all.  The portions are wonderfully huge and your mouth will be watering the next day waiting for lunch to arrive so you can finish it.  \n\nBest of all...despite the fact that this feels like a \"Saturday night special place\"  its affordable enough to enjoy any night of the week almost.  Especially because most of you will get two meals out of it!!!\n\nI have learned to love The Persian Room also.  But PARS is so much classier...so much more romantic...so much more \"approachable\" for those of us not from the middle east.  And the food is better here too.  \n\nGotta check this place out!!!!
0,A stay that started with friends being able to get the keys before I got there simply by saying they were staying in 924 (and show no ID) and ended with the head of Housekeeping looking at her watch when she stopped by at 12:05 pm checkout day while I was waiting for a friend to bring around the car and would be out in 5-10 minutes.  Don't stay here - they clearly see customers as a (un)necessary evil.\n\nThat said  there were several friendly staffers - Candy (Front Desk)  Hope (restaurant)  and Saturday's morning shuttle driver and while there  the room was functional  clean and met our needs.\n\nThe stay began 300 miles away when I checked in online via HHonors.com and chose a great room on the top floor and called ahead to add friends to the reservation since they would be arriving earlier than I would.  The first time friends stopped by  the front desk person said they weren't on the reservation.  When they return after I added them  they spoke with a different clerk than they had earlier or I did on the phone - and were given keys without being asked for ID.  That has to be illegal (if not  it should be).\n\nThey go up to the room to find the HVAC unit in pieces unassembled - luckily we had a good weather weekend  but that could be a rough bump in the night going into the grate over the plastic casing of the unit.  As the stay progressed things were relatively uneventful.  The restaurant and shuttle service did an excellent job Saturday making our stay for the Pitt vs. Georgia Tech Football game a good day.  Much appreciation to those named above for making that happen.\n\nThis morning  we had a lot of interaction with the people who run this hotel.  At the restaurant  the Director of Food & Beverage was taking orders for the made-to-order breakfast; of the three of us  the last person's order wasn't included on our ticket.  So  one of the servers took the number from our table making it difficult for them to find us once the third person's food was ready.  So hard in fact  that they gave her food to another table that even said it was what they'd ordered.  This was straightened out eventually  but it is interesting how the staff managed a packed house the day before flawlessly  and today a sparsely filled dining room was tricky for the Director of Food & Beverage to manage.  Most staff was the same - and maybe they were tired - but it really did seem that changing who took the orders may have impacted the accuracy of food delivery.\n\nLastly  at check-out  I was preparing to walk out the door (which had the 'do not disturb' tag on it  and there came a knock and I said I'd be out in 5-10 minutes.  In fairness  it was 12:05.  Another knock came and I opened the door - the Head of Housekeeping was there with her clipboard.  I explained that I was hustling to get ready and would be out in 5-10 - to which she responded \"okay\" and she looked down at her watch.  When I express dissatisfaction with her attitude  she said \"sorry you feel that way  this room was marked as vacant which is why I checked.\"  To which I responded  please don't apologize for how I feel about something - please apologize for your actions.  I realize this was a bit harsh  but I didn't appreciate that this was the last impression I'd have of this hotel - and she felt it was okay that that impression be a negative one.\n\nHigh potential staff  but management has a lot of improvement needed.  Try the Residence Inn Pittsburgh University instead.
0,Not vegetarian friendly  the waitstaff lies  or the wait staff have no idea what ingredients they are serving. You take your pick  most likely all three are true. \n\nI asked our waiter a simple question  \"Most miso soup is made with fish broth  do you know if your is?\" He responded no and listed the ingredients. He reassured me it was vegetarian. As soon as my soup arrived and I tasted it I could tell it contained fish broth. The waiter was apologetic and I ordered another side dish.\n\nAs we were leaving we spoke to the manager who claimed he came by our table and spoke to us during dinner. He had not. I left feeling like place was full of a bunch of liars. It would have been catastrophic if I had a fish allergy instead of being a 20 year veteran of vegetarianism.\n\nToo bad I will not be returning  the restaurant has a great view.
0,We were so excited to eat a last meal here  before there closing. Called at 5:30 to make a reservation for 6:30. Never received a call back confirming. Arrived with my party at 6:30 to be told there would be no availability until 8. Came back at 8  seated by 8:45 to be told there was no bread. About 50% of the reason anyone goes here. The server tells us they were out for an hour and a half  well before we were seated. They then proceeded to forget two of our sides  one being my roquefort salad  the other 49% of why I go there  and my friends macaroni and cheese. These people have given up. Save your money  sanity  and preserved memory of what this place used to be  because these people murdered it  and sold it out.
2,First place that actually refillef my drink! There setup was not all the great. Some of the dishes didn't even look fresh. I like that they had the dessert near the entrance because that's the most important display...at least in my opinion. I need to know how much space to save! The server was very attentive and friendly. She refilled my drink without being asked..that may not seem important to most  but after eating at numerous places to my shock and dismay  they never refilled or even asked. I was confused as to why they had mexican dishes in the american section as well.  Not one of my top choices but it is cheap and service was good.\n\nAnother great thing about this place. SELF SERVE EGGS BENEDICT! oh my...i couldn't help myself at this station.
0,This was the worst Mcdonalds in all of Las Vegas.  My daughter wanted a breakfast burrito and I needed a coffee. 1 car in front in of me and 23 minutes stuck in the drive thru. WHO's the manager? I didnt see one person that was capable of being in charge of running that place. Next tiem I decide to go to Mcdonalds by my job I will hop on the freeway and go to another one and still return to work faster then running across the street to this one!!!!!!
4,Casa is 2 rooms now  one is tables and couches  tasty nachos and sandwiches  zine library - a pretty  ramshackle  dim  perfect space for thinking  drinking  drawing and eating vegetarian tasty inexpensive eats. The second room is a dedicated performance venue accessible from a backside door in the resto/cafe. A perfect little venue for ~100 to cozy up to exceptional music and feel tucked away from the world. The people behind Casa also run the music venue across the street at Sala as well as a sweet space for travelers above Casa called Pensione Popolo  and they do a lot of the booking for Il Motore up on Jean Talon. They also run a festival of resistance music called Suoni Per Il Popolo that brings life-changing music into close encounters with the city. 5 stars fer sure.
0,I had been using Hardy's Pool Care to service my pool since April of 2014.  On 9/1/2014 I notified the owner via email that September would be my last month of service for the winter and that I would notify them when I wanted to re-start the service in spring.  Please note that I had pre-paid for the month of September as required by the business.  They completed service for the weeks of 9/1  9/8 and 9/15.  On 9/24  I called them because they had not completed my service on 9/23 as scheduled. The owner apologized and said he was running a bit behind but that he would service the pool that day which has happened before and that's cool as long as I'm notified which I never was unless I called them. At any rate  he didn't show up as promised.  On 9/25  I called him and left a message and he did not return my call; I tried twice on 9/25 to reach him. On 9/26  I called him and left a message for him to call me back never heard back from him.  So  I've now filed a complaint with the BBB in hopes that I can get a refund for the remaining 2 services.\n\nIt's a shame that they decided to treat me this way because they did a good job for the most part.  Now  I'll never use them again.  I'll find a more reliable service.
2,I never really trust reviews for clubs just because I know it varies from night to night and also different promotional groups for each night. For this night it was a weeknight and they had Tyga guest performing. The promoter told us I could still get in with discounted rate by 12:30am but the bouncer kept us specifically in line until 12:35am... ended up having to pay $50  totally sucks.\n\nThe club isn't anything crazy  it really reminds me of a strip club if anything. Crowd was mixed primarily black/white with a few token Asians. The crowd that night was a bit ratchet... some black girl tried to pick my pocket until I caught her. Other than that  it's one of the few remainly hip hop clubs that play some good club bangers.\n\nI did have a gripe with the DJ  not sure if it's just how hip hop clubs are nowadays but they literally only play like 1 min of each song and before u really get into it  they switch to another song. no transitions or anything  really rough mixes.
2,The hotel amenities and service get the three-star rating.  The bed gets a two-star rating.  Lumpy and bumpy and stiff as a concrete slab.  I've definitely had better beds in other hotels of the same star-rating.  \n\nThe free continental breakfast offered the standard fare but it's enough to satisfy most people.  \n\nThe employees are friendly and courteous.  The hotel is pet friendly.  The grounds are well-kept. Ample parking for their establishment. \n\nThe highlight is the free shuttle service offered to anyplace within a 5 mile radius of the hotel.  A plus since there are so many strip malls and eateries surrounding La Quinta.\n\nThere is free wi-fi in the lobby area but wired internet service in the rooms.  Although wired  it is FREE.
0,They are only getting one star because yelp requires it.  \n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nWas caught behind an accident that was keeping me from picking up my call in order.  Nothing to do about that out here  Hunt Highway is one lane each way.. One would think that this would be an acceptable excuse to not pick up my call in order  and I thought it best to call and let them know I would not be able to make it in. Oh  no!  The man on the other end screamed at me!!  Called me nasty names and called me (expletive) stupid!  Told me he would call the sheriff as he had my phone number.  I tried to explain the situation once again  however  he could not even hear me as he was screaming at me at the top of his voice!  I finally had to hang up on him.  Needless to say  this was my first and last time trying this Chen's Chinese Restaurant. Will drive the extra distance to go to the Chen's down the road near the Safeway in Florence.
